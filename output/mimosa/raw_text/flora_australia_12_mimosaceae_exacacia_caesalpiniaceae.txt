The Australian material of this species commonly has glabrous leaflets but occasional
specimens with sparingly appressed-puberulous leaflets have been seen; specimens seen from
New Guinea, Solomon Is. and other Malesian localities appear to exhibit the latter condition
more frequently.
Distinct from the native A. abrosperma which has generally smaller leaflets, shorter
inflorescences (nearly sessile flowers), non-coiled pod valves and bicoloured seeds.
A specimen from Strathmore HS, west of Proserpine, Qld (S.L.Everist 6437, BRI), and well
south of the main distribution, has smaller leaflets, but the seeds in the single pod examined
is typical of this species.

Degener (Fl. Hawaiiensis 2: family 169a, 1937) reported that seed of this species (as
P. chilensis (Molina) Stuntz) had been sent to Australia from Hawai'i.  All the Prosopis on
Hawai’i is believed to have originated from a single tree planted by Catholic missionaries in
1828. While it is understood that the seed was imported from Paris, its origin was
presumably South American. Australian P. pallida is phenotypically very similar to that
naturalised in Hawai’i, Panetta & Carstairs (1989) found the Hughenden and Minderoo
populations to be identical and to differ from the Hawaiian test material only by the absence
of one rare allele, Hawai’i, therefore, would seem to be the likely origin of the Australian
P. pallida.
Pedley (1977) adopted P. limensis for this taxon on the basis that P. limensis was pubescent
whereas P. pallida was glabrous. I have examined all the specimens on which each of these
names was based and find them all to be hairy and, in my opinion, conspecific.
Although P. pallida is not closely related to P. velutina, vegetative specimens are sometimes
confused. These can be most readily distinguished by the number of pairs of pinnae per leaf.
Prosopis pallida usually has 2-4 pairs (occasionally a few leaves may have only 1 pair)
whereas the leaves of P. velutina usually have only 1 or 2 pairs of pinnae (occasionally a few
leaves may have 3 pairs). If pods are present there is no difficulty in identification; those of
P. pallida are glabrous whereas those of P. velutina are hairy even in old age.

Prosopis juliflora, P. glandulosa and P. velutina are so closely related that they are
sometimes (e.g. Benson, 1941) considered to be conspecific. I have followed Johnston
(1962) and Burkart (1976) in treating them as distinct. Prosopis juliflora differs from the
other two in having soft, herbaceous leaflets which appear somewhat curled or corrugated
when dry. The internodes of the pinnae axes of P. glandulosa are considerably longer than
those of either P. juliflora or P. velutina. Prosopis velutina is readily distinguished from the
other two taxa by its hairy pods.

All of the Australian specimens of P. glandulosa have been referred to var. glandulosa. However,
two of the specimens, from the Darling Downs (B.Freeman, MEL 716122) and from Roma
(Thomas, BRI), have shorter leaflets and internodes of the pinna axes than is usual. This could be
the result of introgression from P. glandulosa var. torreyana (L.D.Benson) M.CJohnst. Putative

(Benson, 1941; Isley, 1972).

Specimens referred to this complex are phenotypically intermediate between P. velutina and
P. glandulosa. Isozyme studies by Panetta & Carstairs (1989) confirmed the presence of
P. glandulosa genes in the Mardie and Rockvale populations; they also indicated some
introgression from P. pallida. While not implying that either population was simply a hybrid
between P. glandulosa and P. pallida, Panetta & Carstairs were unable to suggest which
other species might be involved. The presence of P. pallida could not be verified
morphologically, suggesting that any introgression from that species was minor. Prosopis
velutina and P. glandulosa var. torreyana are known to hybridise in Arizona, U.S.A., where
both taxa occur naturally (Benson, 1941; Johnston, 1962; Isley, 1972), and this is a possible
source of the hybrid. Phenotypically similar plants are also naturalised in southern Africa.

If the rules of botanical nomenclature were strictly applied, this species would have to be
referred to as M. pellita Humb. & Bonpl. ex Willd., but the name M. pigra has been
conserved. However, while the conservation accords well with usage by botanists working
with Asian and African floras, it is based on the most unfortunate choice of a conserved type
given above (see Cowan, 1996).
This is a very serious, pantropical weed, spreading rapidly by adventitious rooting and
forming impenetrable thickets

A pantropical species, presumably originally from the Western Hemisphere but the precise
centre of origin is not known; in Australia it occurs principally in Qld but also infrequently
in N.T. Three varieties occur in Australia as naturalised weeds, probably all the result of
introduction for or with forage. The following key and descriptions are adapted from Barneby

Differs from f. glandulosa only in the eglandular petioles. This is seemingly a weak
distinction but the geographic distribution of the two forms suggests that more detailed,
perhaps statistical studies, are needed to confirm or refute the reality of the two forms. The
typical form is especially common and widespread in Qld and in northern N.S.W., occurring
in a more dispersed pattern in northern W.A. and N.T.; f. glandulosa has a scattered
distribution from the Napier Range, W.A., and in inland N.T., where it is most common, to
Qld (mostly in the west but with a few near-coastal localities). Both forms vary widely in
pubescence type (puberulous, villous or hirsute) and in its density (very dense to lacking).

There is considerable variation in the amount of pubescence present, as well as in the kinds
of hairs, but there appears to be no obvious patterns related to other morphological features
or geographic distribution. Completely glabrous specimens occur in the same general area as
samples with villous vegetative parts, bracts and peduncles.
It is typical for the peduncles to have 2 bracts towards the base but occasionally 2 additional,
smaller ones occur towards the apex (e.g. R.W.Purdie 3309, c. 4 km from Wyndham, W.A.,
CANB).
The nearest relative is undoubtedly N. monosperma which, like this species, has 1-seeded
pods, but these are circular or nearly so and only minutely puberulous or glabrous. In
addition, the pinnae of N. monosperma are longer and the peduncular bracts generally
smaller.
A specimen of this taxon, mixed with a collection of N. gracilis f. glandulosa (Rockhampton,
Qld, Sept. 1865, A.Dietrich, MEL), is not thought to be a part of that original collection
because N. dimorphantha does not occur as far east as Rockhampton.

Australian specimens have uniformly glabrous leaves and inflorescence axes but those of the
type, as well as some other extra-Australian collections, have sparingly appressed-puberulous
leaflets and inflorescences. When there is sufficient, complete Australian material of the
species, it may require recognition as a distinct infraspecific taxon. Available Australian
material lacks pods, even immature ones, and the description of pods and seeds above is from
Nielsen (1985).

Probably native to SE Asia, possibly also East Africa, but now pantropical and widely
cultivated in areas with a seasonal climate. Naturalised and occurring in northern W.A. from
near Napier Range (c. 120 km E of Derby) north to Kuri Bay and Cape Bougainville in
coastal and near-coastal monsoon forest and vine thickets, sometimes in savannah woodland,
often along watercourses, in sand, clay-sand and lateritic clay, often in association with
basalt and less commonly limestone. It occurs in N.T. in coastal areas from Cox Peninsula
(near Darwin) to Wanyu Beach (c. 30 km SE of Murgenella), also on Elcho Is. (c. 130 km
WNW of Nhulunbuy); and in Qld from Thursday Is. south to near Charters Towers, and also
at Riversleigh Stn (c. 120 km NE of Camooweal). Many records are from homesteads and
similar areas where the species is undoubtedly cultivated but in coastal forests and thickets
across the northern part of the range it has become thoroughly naturalised. On the other
hand, collections made in coastal Qld from Mackay south-east to near Kilkivan (c. 45 km E
of Gympie) represent more recent naturalisation. Map 28.

Albizia lebbeck var. pubescens Benth. was described on the basis of the branchlets, leaves
and inflorescences being softly pubescent. Although I have not seen any authentic material of
this taxon, the use of pubescence as a distinguishing character is of dubious value as the
pubescent and glabrous forms do not otherwise differ in Australia.
Most similar to A. retusa which, however, has fewer, white flowers in each of the flower-
clusters and narrower pods.

Completely glabrous individuals are rarely encountered, although even in these the perianth
has scattered, almost microscopic, appressed hairs (e.g. T. & J.Whaite 4256 (PERTH, NSW)

(e.g. G.M.Storr (PERTH 01665758) from Waychinicup, W.A.). Most of the material falls
between these extremes insofar as pubescence is concerned.
Quite different from P. toona which has flowers in compound panicles of short spikes,
narrower leaflets and thinner seeds.

specimens can be distinguished from those of P. lophantha subsp. lophantha by the much
smaller leaflets.
Another entity, apparently closely related to P. toona, is represented by material which is
inadequate either for determining the generic alignment with certainty or for preparing an
adequate description. It has massive, strongly-raised, extrafloral nectaries, rust-coloured,
short pubescence, and the appressed-puberulous flowers (very young bud) are in short spikes
arranged in panicles. It is a large, rainforest tree in the Daintree region, Qld, represented by
five collections: B.Hyland 2314 and 2468 (BRI), B.Hyland 3194 and 10638 (CANB) and
B.Gray 1968 (CANB). Flowering and fruiting specimens are needed to elucidate the identity
and relationships of this taxon.

The minute dendroid hairs on many parts of the plant are dark brown-red and have been
described as glandular (Bentham, 1864; Nielsen et al., 1983). The proportion of dendroid to
unicellular hairs varies substantially among collections of what otherwise is certainly the
same taxon.

conspicuous dendroid hairs characteristic of A. basaltica.

An uncommon species, at least only infrequently collected, and very often infected with a
pathogen that affects the leaves, producing corky growths on the axes.
Not clearly related to either of the other two species and perhaps closer to extra-Australian

As noted by Nielsen (1982), there is considerable variation in size of flowers among the
collections studied. F.Mueller apparently had in mind the description of a variety based on
flower size which he never published, but he annotated several collections by A.W.Persieh
from the Endeavour River area as 'A. hendersonii var. persiehana’. Collections with smaller
than usual flowers have been made from several scattered localities over the years (e.g.
S.Johnson 1667a (BRI) from Mt Saunders, Cooktown, Qld).
Related to A. grandiflorum which has leaves with a stalked or conical gland on the leaf axis
below the basal pair of pinnae and at each pair of pinnae, as well as often on the axes of the
pinnae at the insertion of the leaflet pairs; it also has more pairs of pinnae and leaflets and it
has fewer, larger flowers in each cluster.

Variation in the leaves is largely confined to the number of leaflet pairs. As noted in the
protologue, the usual situation of a pina having 1 terminal pair of leaflets and 1 basal leaflet
sometimes breaks down and one finds 2 or more leaflets inserted altemately on the pina
axis; however, this is atypical. The collection S.Clark et al. 1591 from Upper Crystal Ck,
c. 11.5 km NW of Murwillumbah, N.S.W., is sterile. It may represent this species but its
leaflets are differently shaped and its branchlets and leaf axes are puberulous.
The authors of the species were impressed by the fact that the calyx reaches its full
development before appearance of the corolla and described the two perianth parts of about
equal length. While these observations may be true in buds or very young flowers, the corolla
is always substantially longer in fully open ones; in some instances the corolla tube is not
exserted beyond the calyx, the lobes free at least to the level of the calyx mouth.
A very distinctive species on account of its relatively small leaflets and flowers. Very closely
elated to A. kanisii; also related to A. whitei which has a solitary leaflet on each pina.

Nielsen (op. cit. 486) in his review of the genus, discusses the identity of the collection
Pentzke 4, cited above as the holotype of Pithecellobium pentzkeanum (Ewart) Mohlenbr.,

Related to C. bonduc and sometimes difficult to distinguish from it. The description of the
seeds as black in Wheeler et al. (eds), op. cit. 344, probably refers to seed of C. bonduc. At
MEL there is a collection of seeds from Richmond R., N.S.W., Mrs Hodgkinson (possibly
cultivated) that may be this species. Caesalpinia broomensis is placed here in synonymy on
the basis of its stipules being described as small, filiform and often curved, which fits those
of C. major rather than C. bonduc. This is the only species of the genus recorded from
Broome, W.A.

the Gulf of Carpentaria and from sand plains and dunes in the south-west of the range are
rather distinctive; however, these grade into ‘normal’ populations of the species.

3-17-foliolate; rachis 0.15—4.8 cm long. Leaflets narrowly oblong to obovate- or elliptic-
oblong, 1-3.5 cm long, 1.5-10 mm wide; upper surface with uncinate hairs especially when
young, the raised bases persisting; lower surface glabrous or with scattered hairs especially
on midrib,  Racemes 2-10-flowered, often as long as or longer than the leaves. Sepals 5; outer

A polymorphic species within which a considerable range of variation in leaflet number and
size is encountered. The extremes look quite different but they are linked by intermediates so
that when the entire range of variation is inspected it is difficult to divide it satisfactorily.
There is an inconsistent tendency for leaflet number to be correlated with leaflet width and,
to a lesser extent, with shape and geographical distribution. The name L. tephrosiifolia
Meisn. was used to refer to the southern populations with numerous pairs of narrow leaflets.
Detailed field studies are required to determine whether there is a satisfactory means of
dividing the range of variation and whether or not formal recognition of infraspecific taxa
within L. cassioides is desirable.

The Mt Mulligan population differs slightly from typical L. brassii in leaflet shape and size.
The leaflets are consistently narrowly elliptic, usually lack undulate margins and are slightly
smaller, the lateral leaflets being 2.75-7 mm wide (4-11 mm wide in typical L. brassii) and
the terminal leaflets 1.8-4 cm long and 5-9 mm wide (3.5—4.6 cm long and 11-17 mm wide
in typical L. brassii). In addition, the indumentum of the young branchlets is slightly denser
and the lower leaflet surfaces are more densely pubescent than in typical L. brassii.
This is a poorly known species with unclear affinities.

lying sandy areas often among coastal sand dunes. Map 159.
Qld: Cape Flattery, P.Sharpe 1529 (BRI); between Mclvor R. and Cape Flattery, A.Dockrill 623 (QRS); near
Cape Bedford, L.Pedley 2625 (BRI); S of Cape Bedford, J.R.Clarkson 3301 (BRI, QRS).
The obtuse, emarginate or only slightly apiculate leaflet apices are in contrast to the
distinctly pungent apices found in other species, and the pods differ from those of other
species examined in that the short, erect hairs are not uncinate.
The seeds are reported (Dockrill 623) to be edible either raw or cooked.
The identity of L.S.Smith 11145 (BRI), a sterile specimen from the Hoop Pine area near
Mclvor River, is not clear but it possibly represents a local expression of L. buettneriana. It
differs from other material in having larger leaves and larger (3.5-7 cm long) oblong-elliptic
leaflets. More material of this variant, especially fertile material, is required to confirm its
identity.

Most specimens can be referred readily either to subsp. lanceolata or to subsp. brevifolia.
However, occasional specimens, for example C.E.Woolcock s.n. (MEL) from 5.5 km from
Toodyay and E.Pritzel 554 (AD, W) from the Avon district, are difficult to place with
certainty. These specimens are atypical in having some 4-foliolate leaves as in subsp.
brevifolia but, as they have the general facies of subsp. lanceolata with the central leaflet
very much larger than the laterals, they are referred to subsp. lanceolata.

In subsp. brevifolia some leaves are occasionally 3-foliolate but these are always
accompanied by leaves with 4-6 leaflets.
Four specimens from outlying localities north of the main distributional range have narrower
leaflets than usual and a somewhat different facies as a consequence. The specimens in
question are A.C.Burns 98 (PERTH) from East Yuna which is separated apparently from
other populations by a large, geographical discontinuity, C.A.Gardner 12149 (PERTH) from
Ninghan, C.A.Gardner 12126 (PERTH) from Waddourin Hill and W.E.Blackall 3400

Petalostylis labicheoides is relatively uniform throughout its range and can usually be
distinguished without difficulty from P. cassioides by a combination of leaflet number, shape
and size and the length of the leaf rachis. The former tends to have short leaves with few
large leaflets in contrast to P. cassioides which tends to have longer leaves with more
numerous smaller leaflets.
The two species have different distributional ranges which show little overlap except perhaps
between Onslow and Carnarvon, W.A., and in the Burke, Gregory and Mitchell districts of
Qld.

Petalostylis cassioides, as treated here, is a polymorphic species, unlike P. labicheoides. The
extremes look very different but when the entire range of variation is inspected it is difficult
to divide it satisfactorily as the extremes are linked by numerous and varied intermediates.
A critical evaluation and detailed field studies are required in order to establish whether any
of the taxa placed in synonymy under P. cassioides warrant formal recognition at some rank.
Occasional specimens are difficult to place in either of the two species with certainty, for
example, Shields 2 (BRI) from 32-64 km SSW of Winton on the Opalton road, Qld. This
specimen has some of the attributes of each species: it differs from typical P. labicheoides in
having more numerous leaflets on some leaves and from typical P. cassioides in leaflet
shape. The specimen is rather similar to P. cassioides, falls within the distributional range of
this species, and has been referred to it hesitantly. Despite these occasional difficulties,
P. cassioides and P. labicheoides appear to be sufficiently distinctive to warrant specific
rank,

Apparently deciduous. The calyx separates from its base and remains as a loose collar on the
pedicel of the mature pod. Although recorded for north-western N.S.W. by S.McCune &
B.Wiecek, in G.J.Harden (ed.), Fl. New South Wales 2: 323-324 (1991), no collections from
that State have been seen. A collection from 50 km N of Hughenden (D.H.Benson 630,
NSW) may be a variant or a new taxon: leaflets 11-18 mm long; pedicels 5 mm long,
appressed-pubescent; calyx 10 mm long, campanulate, the tube almost glabrous; lobes
openly and shortly appressed-pubescent; petals pubescent outside, the longest 15 mm long;
filaments c. 28 mm long, glabrous; pistil 25 mm long, glabrous, the stipe sparsely pubescent
along one edge. Fruit are needed to assist determining its rank. This and subsequent taxa
placed in subg. Phanera.
