Acacia collinsii is the only ant-acacia known from
South America. This species has enlarged stipular
spines inhabited by acacia-ants of the genus Pseu-
domyrmex (Ward 1993) and beltian bodies on the
tips of the leaflets. Cyanide tests of more than 400
specimens of Acacia collinsii from throughout its
geographic range indicate that this species is not
cyanogenic (Seigler and Ebinger 1995). Herbarium
material of this species was reported cyanogenic
(Seigler et al. 1978), but reinvestigation of these
same specimens failed to confirm activity (Seigler
and Ebinger 1987). Janzen (1981) did not report cy-
anogenesis for this taxon.

Acacia rorudiana is restricted to Ecuador, and
mostly to the Galapagos Islands, though Rudd
(1971) indicated that it may occur in Chile. This tax-
on has been variously treated as a distinct species
(Robinson 1902; Rudd 1971), and as a synonym of
A. macracantha (Svenson 1946). The stalked bulbous
glands on the petiole and rachis of A. rorudiana are
much different from the stalked, flattened glands of
A. macracantha. Also in A. rorudiana, the small (0.6-
2.8 mm long), narrow leaflets (0.3-0.8 mm wide),
the short petiole (2-8 mm long), the short shoots
above each pair of stipular spines, the extreme var-
iation in the number of pinna pairs per leaf (12 to
35), and the wide fruits (10-17 mm) separate this
taxon from A. macracantha. In this study, no speci-
men referable to A. macracantha was found on the
Galapagos Islands; all specimens previously anno-
tated by various authors as A. macracantha are here
referred to A. rorudiana.
Adsersen et al. (1988) found that both fresh and
preserved material of A. rorudiana were strongly cy-
anogenic. In our study more than 75% of the 63
herbarium specimens tested were strongly cyano-
genic. Usually more recently collected material
gave a stronger positive test than material that was
collected 30 to 50 years ago.

plish, becoming light gray with age, symmetrical,
terete to oval in cross section, straight, stout, to 60
mm long (rarely longer), 1-3 mm wide near the
base, glabrous to pubescent at the base and some-
times throughout. Petiole adaxially grooved, 5-13

globose apex, usually glabrous (Fig. 5B). Rachis
adaxially grooved, to 240 mm long, glabrous to
densely puberulent to lanate, a small circular gland
0.4-0.6 mm across between the upper 1-3 (8) pina
pairs, the apex flattened and with raised margins
to globose. Pinnae 12 to 45 pairs per leaf, 20-45 mm
long, 2-8 mm between pinna pairs. Petiolules 0.7-
1.3 mm long. Leaflets 19 to 47 pairs per pina, op-
posite, 0.5-1.2 mm between leaflets, linear, 1.7-4.5

Throughout its geographic range Acacia macracan-
tha is highly variable morphologically, numerous va-
rietal and specific names have been applied to plants
of this species (Bentham 1875; Isely 1973; Madsen
1990; Seigler and Ebinger 1988). This taxon is highly
variable in the type and degree of pubescence on
vegetative parts of the plant, ranging from glabrous
to puberulent in most of Mexico and northern South
America, to densely pubescent in the Caribbean Is-
lands, to densely lanate throughout much of Chile,
Ecuador, and Peru. Also, leaf and leaflet size varies
extensively. Throughout northern South America
(Columbia and Venezuela), and north through Cen-
tral America, most individuals have leaves with 18
to 45 pinna pairs and the leaflets that exceed 3.0 mm.
in length; whereas in Chile, Ecuador, and Peru many
individuals have smaller leaves (12-20 pinna pairs)
and leaflets (1.7-2.5 mm long). These characteristics
are not consistent enough to distinguish separate va-
rieties or subspecies, as many individuals with in-
termediate characteristics are encountered. Aronson
(1991), discussing the distribution of this species in
Chile, mentioned that the “variability in size and
shape of the pods, leaves, and stipular spines of A.
macracantha has led to its being split into numerous
regional taxa, many of which appear to be of dubi-
ous
Acacia macracantha specimens are usually cyano-
genic. In specimens from Mexico and Central
America, Seigler and Ebinger (1988) found 89%
were cyanogenic. In our study, of the 230 specimens
examined, 91% tested positive for cyanide, usually
strongly so. The compound proacacipetalin is re-
sponsible for this activity (Seigler et al. 1978, Seigler
and Conn 1982).

The only species in South America that A. aroma
is usually confused with is A. macracantha, Though
superficially similar, numerous characteristics can
be used for consistent separation. Acacia aroma has
flattened fruits that are constricted between the
seeds, many of the peduncles are more than 22mm
long, and the petiole glands are sessile. Acacia ma-
cracantha, in contrast, has flattened fruits that are
not constricted between the seeds, the peduncles
are less than 25 mm long, and the petiole gland is
stalked. Besides the characteristics listed above,
short shoots are common in A. aroma, whereas they
are mostly absent in A. macracantha. These short
shoots, which develop just above the stipular
spines, usually produce many small leaves. It is not
uncommon for these short shoot leaves to lack a
petiolar gland, or the gland is smaller and more
bulbous than on the node leaves.
It appears that A. aroma is only rarely cyanogenic.
Aronson and Nash (1989) reported negative results
for this species, while Aronson (1990) found some
seedlings to be slightly to moderately cyanogenic.
Of the 220 specimens tested during the present
study 215 gave a negative reaction even after the
addition of emulsin. A weak positive cyanogenic
reaction was observed in five specimens. Seigler
and Conn (1982) found linamarin and lotaustralin
to be the principal glycosides in this species.

Most herbarium labels indicate that the speci-
mens were low growing, prostrate shrubs less than
1m tall with a crown diameter of 2-3 m. From the
information on the herbarium sheets, as well as
what is mentioned by Svenson (1946) and Madsen
(1990), this taxon commonly grows directly on
wind-exposed sandy sea-shores or just behind
mangroves. At higher elevations, it commonly is
found along water courses where specimens are re-
ported to be less than 1 m tall and nearly 5 m
across.
Specimens of Acacia aroma var. huarango are con-
sistently more puberulent that var. aroma, particu-
larly on the leaflets of var: huarango, which are light-
ly puberulent on the lower surface. In addition, the
petiolar glands of var. marango are nearly circular,
smaller (0.4-0.9 mm across), more bulbous and
usually densely puberulent. This variety also differs
from var. aroma in that the leaflets (mostly less than
2.5 mm long), petioles (3-5 mm long), pinnae (less
than 20 mm long), and the number of leaflets per
pinna (less than 30) are at the lower size range for
A. aroma var. aroma. Occasional specimens of var.
Iwarango are cyanogenic; of the 30 specimens ex-
amined, five gave a weak reaction after 12 hours.
Macbride (1943), in a list of representative spec-
imens, cited a Ruiz and Pav6n specimen, (Hudnuco:
near Hudnuco, low spreading shrub) as the lecto-
type. A specimen at F (#845461) with the label Plan-
tae a “Ruiz et Pavén’’ in vice-regno Peruviano et
Chilensi lectae (1778-1788) is probably the speci-
men mentioned as the lectotype.

The large, sessile petiolar glands, the dense, gray
to yellow-green pubescence that covers most young
parts of the plant, and the wider (16-30 mm) fruits
distinguished Acacia pennatula from other South
American acacias of subgenus Acacia. Of the mate-
rial examined from Mexico, only 21% of the speci-
mens tested contained cyanogenic compounds
(Seigler et al. 1978; Seigler and Conn 1982; Seigler
and Ebinger 1988), whereas all South American
specimens of A. pennatula were cyanogenic, usually
strongly so.

Acacia karroo Hayne is a highly variable, poly-
morphic taxon in which formal intraspecific cate-
gories are not easily recognized (Ross, 1979). It dif
fers from all native South American acacias by hav-
ing the involucral bracts near the middle of the pe-
duncle, and legumes that have an endocarpic strip
along the inside of each valve, a characteristic oth-
erwise found in members of the Acacia rigidula com-
plex of North America (Lee et al, 1989). The de-
scription presented here is based largely on the
New World specimens examined.

Acacia nilotica is an exceedingly variable species,
nine subspecies having been delimited, mainly on
differences in the shape, size and pubescence of the
fruits (Ross, 1979). Similar in many regards to
members of the Acacia farnesiana group of the New
World, it has stipular spines to 150 mm long, pet-
ioles to 30 mm long often with a large, petiolar
gland near the lower pinna pair, leaves with 1 to 9
pinnae pairs, 11 to 27 pairs of leaflets per pinna,
and a capitate inflorescence. It differs from all na-
tive South American species by having the involu-
cral bracts near the middle of the peduncle, flat-
tened legumes that are relatively wide (9-21 mm),
densely white tomentose and usually deeply con-
stricted between the seeds. The description pre-
sented here is based largely on the New World
specimens examined.

A filament-tube occurs in some members of Aca-
cia insulae-iacobi, a condition mentioned by Riley
(1925) in the original description. During the pre-
sent study eight flowering specimens, mostly from
San Salvador, had filament-tubes, sometimes to 1.5
mum long. The tube was very delicate, and separated
easily into the individual filaments. The floral re-
mains at the base of young fruits of some of these
specimens had the filaments separate. The speci-
mens with a filament-tube generally were more ro-
bust, had slightly larger, and more leaves, and were
possibly associated with more mesic conditions.
This taxon has been considered conspecific with
A. albicorticata (Rudd 1971) as both have short spur
branches, bipinnately compound leaves with 1 to 4
pairs of pinnae, relatively large leaflets (usually ex-
ceeding 7 mm in length) with obvious secondary
veins, and similar rachis glands. Numerous char-
acteristics, however, can be used for consistent sep-
aration, the most obvious being the papery, peeling
bark of A. albicorticata. Also, in A. insulae-iacobi, pet-
ioles are 1-6 mm long and have a medial gland, the
inflorescence is solitary, and the calyx is 1.5-2.2 mm
long. In A. albicorticata, in contrast, the petiole is 7—
30 mm long, the petiolar gland is located between
the lower pina pair, the inflorescences are clus-
tered, and the calyx is 1.0-1.4 mm long. Both spe-
cies appear to be related to A. farnesiana, and that
species is the probable sister species to A. insulae-
iacobi in mainland Ecuador.
Adsersen et al. (1988) found living material of
this species to be strongly cyanogenic. Of the 37
herbarium specimens tested for the presence of cy-
anogenic compound during the present study, none
gave a positive test even after adding emulsin. It is
possible that the cyanogenic glycoside or the en-
zyme involved with cyanogenesis in this species
was destroyed when the specimens were preserved.

Acacia albicorticata does not appear to be a com-
mon species, being restricted mostly to savannas in
Argentina and Bolivia where its distinctive papery
peeling bark separates it from other acacia species.
In many characteristics it appears to be a large form
of A. farnesiana or A. tortuosa, but its larger, more
widely spaced leaflets, and peeling, papery bark,
separate A. albicorticata from these species. Of the
more than 75 specimens tested for the presence of
cyanogenic compounds, none gave a positive test,
even after the addition of emulsin.

seasonally dry sites in thickets, open pastures, suc-
cessional fields and other disturbed sites from sea
level to about 1500 m (Bush and Van Auken 1995).
Acacia farnesiana has a pantropical distribution, but
was probably introduced in the Old World (Isely
1969).

Acacia farnesiana has been reported from most
countries of South America. In our study, we found
no specimens from Chile or Uruguay, and only a
few from Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay. Re-
ports of this taxon from southern South America
mostly are based on specimens of A. atramentaria or
A. caven, Seigler et al. (1979) found that the major
cyanogenic glycosides of A. farnesiana are linamarin
and lotaustralin, with levels of 5 umol per g of
dried plant material not uncommon. Clarke et al.
(1989) reported that of the numerous Central Amer-
ican specimens of A. farnesiana tested for cyanide,
89% tested positive. Although most tests were
weak, a few were strongly positive. Of the more
than 150 specimens examined from South America,
only 45% were cyanogenic, most being weakly pos-
itive.

Acacia atramentaria occurs in the same general
habitat as A. can, disturbed thorn-scrub forests,
where A. caven is the more common taxon. The
most distinctive characteristic separating this taxon
from other species of Acacia in South America, is
the sessile, torus-shaped petiolar gland at or just
below the lower pinna pair, a characteristic it shares
with A. schaffneri of North America.
On a few herbarium sheets, James Aronson sug-
gested that A. atramentaria and A. caven occasionally
hybridize (Aronson 7906, 7910, 7911 from San Luis,
Argentina). It is possible that these specimens rep-
resent hybrids as the fruits are essentially elliptical
in cross section, and a little wider and thicker than
is typical of A. atramentaria. Only a small amount
of pulpy material is present in the fruits, and the
seeds are in a single row, traits of A. atramentaria.
Vegetative characteristics are within the range of
those for A. atramentaria, including the doughnut-
shaped petiolar gland between the lowest pair of
pinnae. Further studies may clarify this situation.
Of the more than 40 specimens of this species
tested for the presence of cyanogenic compounds,
nearly 25% gave a strongly positive test within two
hours. Most of these positive tests were from re-
cently collected specimens, indicating that the cya-
nogenic glycoside or the degradative enzyme de-
teriorated due to prolonged storage. Seigler et al.
(1979) reported that this taxon was strongly cya-
nogenic, and later (Seigler et al. 1983) determined
that proacacipetalin was the glycoside responsible.
Aronson and Nash (1989) and Aronson (1990) also
reported that A. atramentaria was cyanogenic.

Sousa and Rico (unpublished data) suggested
that this taxon is of hybrid origin involving A. far-
nesiana and A. schaffneri var. schaffneri. This seems
unlikely as the plants appear fully fertile, and A.
farnesiana is usually a tetraploid (2n = 52), whereas
‘A. schaffneri is a diploid (2n = 26). Also, this species
occurs in many areas where A. schaffneri is absent
or uncommon. Janzen and Liesner (1980) recog-
nized the distinctness of this taxon, citing the type
collection, and suggested that it was most closely
related to A. farnesiana. Clarke et al. (1989) recog-
nized these differences, as well as the similarity of
this taxon to A. farnesiana, making it a variety of
that species. The unique morphological character-
istics of this taxon, as well as its distribution sup-
port recognition as a separate species.
Clarke et al. (1989) reported that most specimens
of this species were at least weakly cyanogenic, but
the cyanogenic glycoside was not identified. More
recently, the authors have found many individuals
of this species in Nicaragua that are not cyanogenic
ever after the addition of emulsin.

Acacia caven is an extremely wide-ranging species
that probably originated in the warm temperate to
subtropical biogeographical region known as the
Gran Chaco of southern South America due to high
morphological diversity (Aronson and Ovalle,
1989). This region extends through much of north
central Argentina, adjacent portions of Bolivia, a
small part of the Mato Grosso of Brazil, and nearly
half of Paraguay. Acacia caen also is common in the
Central Valley of Chile in a number of natural eco-
systems of both the semi-arid and subhumid por-
tions of the Mediterranean-type climate of that
country. Ovalle et al. (1990) suggests that it is prob-
ably an invasive species in Chile that has become
common by radical changes to the landscape
brought about by European colonization.
Rarely, ants inhabit the spines of this species.
One specimen (Mereles 1130 from Paraguay) had a
small hole near the tip of the spine. The stipular
spines on this specimen were more than 70 mm
long and 10 mm wide at the base.
Fruit size and shape is highly variable (Spegaz-
zini 1924). Aronson (1992) recognized six varieties
of A. caven based upon pod morphology (dehis-
cence, shape, size, mesocarp color and structure,
and sutural ridges). These include var. caven with
elongated, dark brown pod 5-8 cm long, with one
sutural ridge; var. macrocarpa Aronson with elon-
gated, reddish purple pods more than 8 cm long,
with three distinct sutural ridges; var. stenocarpa
(Spegazzini) Burkart ex Cialdella with light brown,
fusiform pods 3-4 cm long; var. microcarpa (Gpe-
gazzini) Burkart ex Cialdella with subglobose pods
2-3 cm long by 1-1.5 cm wide, and a reddish me-
socarp; var. sphaerocarpa Burkart ex Aronson with
subglobose pods 2.16.5 cm long by 1.64.8 cm
wide, and a white mesocarp; and var. dehiscens Bur-
kart ex Cialdella with dehiscent pods. No other
morphological traits are consistently associated
with the pod characteristics. Baranelli et al. (1995)
noted that the fruit are not always constant on a
single tree. Also, the geographic separation of these
varieties, at the present, appears tenuous. It is the
opinion of the present authors that these variations
in pod morphology are too variable to serve as a
basis for distinguishing varieties.
Molina (1810) originally described this taxon
from specimens found in central Chile, and consid-
ered it to be closely related to A. farnesiana. These
two species are superficially similar, and, as a re-
sult, some subsequent authors have merged the two
taxa (Hassler 1909; Spegazzini 1924). The two taxa
are distinct, and, except for possibly in southeastern
Brazil, are not sympatric. Both species have inflated
pods, short shoots with numerous small leaves, and
similar flowers and inflorescences. In A. farnesiana,
the petiole has a small, circular gland that is raised
above the petiolar groove, leaves with 2 to 6 pinna
pairs, and the leaflets with obvious lateral veins.
Acacia caven, in contrast, has larger, elongated peti-
olar glands that are sessile in the petiolar groove,
many of the leaves have more than 6 pinna pairs,
and the leaflets lack obvious lateral veins.
Aronson and Nash (1989) found that a few her-
barium specimens (5 of 40) released cyanide,
whereas Aronson (1990) observed a slight cyano-
genic reaction with some seedlings and mature
trees of this taxon. During the present study of the
158 herbarium specimens examined for hydrogen
cyanide, nine were cyanogenic, five strongly so.
A taxon starts here.

Aronson and Nash (1989) have suggested that A.
curvifructa is a hybrid between A. caven and A. far-
nesiana. Present information suggests that A. farne-
siana is not common in Argentina or Paraguay; be-
ing present as scattered introductions. Acacia cur-
vifructa is similar to A. farnesiana in that it has rel-
atively large leaflets with obvious secondary
venation; the structure of the petiolar gland, the pu-
berulent petioles, rachis, and the short peduncles,
however, suggest a relationship to A. caven. The
strongly curved fruits of A. curvifructa that are flat-
tened to slightly elliptical in cross section and
densely puberulent with a single row of seeds, are
quite different from the mostly straight, glabrous,
inflated fruits of A. caven, in which the seeds are in
several rows and imbedded in a sweet pulp. The
puberulent leaflets, in which the secondary veins
are obvious, also separate this species from A. cav-
en. Of the 25 specimens of this species examined
for cyanogenic glycosides, none tested positive.

minate stipules and old leaf bases. Leaves alternate,
also commonly clustered on the short shoots, 12
45 mm long. Stipular spines light to dark brown to
purplish, sometimes becoming light gray with age,
symmetrical, terete, straight, stout, 5-40 (55) mm
long, usually more than 1.5 mm wide near the base,
densely pubescent at least toward the base. Petiole

pubescent with erect hairs; petiolar gland solitary,
located medially to near the base of the lower most

ident, only one vein from the base, base oblique,

tuse. Inflorescence a densely flowered globose head
6-9 mm across, solitary to clusters of 2 to 5 on the
short shoots. Peduncles 12-36 mm long, 0.4-0.7 mm

red, deciduous glands. Involucre 4 to 6 lobed, located
at the base of the globose head, persistent, glabrous

riaceous, strongly longitudinally striated, densely
pubescent, usually glandular with minute, reddish
glands, indehiscent but with obvious sutures; stipe

Acacia tortuosa is closely related to A. farnesiana;
these taxa are sometimes considered conspecific. In
A. tortuosa, the fruits are relatively long (65-150 mm)
and narrow (5-9 mm), densely pubescent, and con-
stricted between the uniseriate seeds; while in A. far-
nesiana the fruits are shorter (30-90 mm), broader
(10-18 mm), glabrous, and inflated with biseriate
seeds. Without fruits, consistent separation is still
possible. In A. fortuosa the twigs are strongly flexu-
ous, the petioles, rachises, and spines are densely pu-
bescent, the petioles, even on larger leaves, are 3-7
mm long, the leaflets are strongly ciliate, and the
perianth lobes are puberulent. In A. farnesiana, in
contrast, the twigs are only slightly flexuous, the
plants are usually glabrous to only lightly pubescent,
the petioles are 4 to 17 mm long, the leaflets are not,
or are only slightly ciliate, and the perianth lobes are
commonly glabrous. The petiolar glands of the
smaller leaves of A. tortuosa, particularly those of the
short shoots, are small and circular, similar to those
in A. farnesiana, The leaves of rapidly growing
branches of A. fortuosa, however, have petiolar glands
that are much larger and usually elongated. In the
past, A. tortuosa has also been confused with A.
schaffneri (Tumer 1959; Isely 1969), a taxon of north-
ern Mexico. The circular petiolar gland between the
lower pinna pair in A. schaffneri consistently sepa-
rates this species from A. tortuosa.
Clarke et al. (1989) found that nearly all specimens
(95%) of this taxon from Central and North America
were weakly cyanogenic. Of the 75 specimens tested
from South America, almost all (96%) gave a positive
reaction, but the reaction was weak and slow to de-
velop. In some cases, living material of this species
gives a rapid, positive reaction for cyanide.
