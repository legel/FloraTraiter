1. Mimosa myriadenia (Bentham) Bentham,
Trans. Linn. Soc. London 30: 408. 1875.—
Typus infra sub var. myriadenia indicatur.
Prickly meso- and microphyllidious vines, po-
tentially high-climbing in trees and forming im-
penetrable tangles in forest glades but sometimes
precociously flowering as diffuse shrubs only 1-
2 m, armed along 5 low ribs of young stems and
on ribs of most If-stks and of some pinna-rachises
with retrorse acu/ei to mm, the
hornotinous stems and all If- and inflorescence-
axes pilosulous with short, forwardly incurved
sordid hairs mixed with minute reddish scales,
the foliage bicolored, the Ifts dark-olivaceous
(when dry brownish) and either glabrous or mi-
nutely thinly puberulent above, beneath paler
and either glabrous, or puberulent along primary
nerves, or thinly pilosulous overall, the inter-
venium nearly always dotted with reddish (rarely
pallid or fuscous) scales +0,1 mm diam. (these
rarely wanting, or confined to edge of blade), the
inflorescence an effuse efoliate or proximally few-
lvd panicle of loose amentiform spikelike ra-
cemes of smal] white fragrant fls exserted 1-4 dm
from foliage. Stipules erect subulate 0.8-3.5 x
.25-0.55 mm, nerveless or faintly 1-nerved, be-
coming dry and fragile in age. Leaf-staiks 6-28
em, the petiole 1.3-4.5 cm, at middle 0,7-1.5
mm diam., the longer interpinnal segments 5-
17 mm; a sessile, shallowly patelliform elliptic
nectary 0.3-0,.5 mm tall and 1.3-3.5 mm in long
diameter near base of each If-stk and smaller tub-
shaped or cupular ones below insertion of 1-3
distal pairs of pinnae, and on pinna-rachises
below 1-8 distal pairs of lfts; pinnae of larger Ivs
5-33-jug., a little decrescent proximally, the ra-
chis of longer ones 2.5—7(-8) cm, the longer in-
terfoiiolar segments 0.6—8 mm; Ifts of longer pin-
nae 8—40-jug., the small first pair 0.2-3 mm from
subulate paraphyllidia 0.2-0.6 mm, the middie
pairs (further described under each var.) linear-
oblong or rhombic-oblong from subequilateral
or strongly inequilatera! base, either acute,
rounded and mucronate, or obtuse, the longest
ones 3-15 x 0.7-8 mm, the terminal pair dis-
similar to the rest, obliquely oblanceolate or ob-
ovate, the blades all veintess or almost so above,
beneath 1-5S-nerved from pulvinule, the venu-
lation becoming more complex with increasing
width of blade. Racemes mostly fasciculate by
2-5 per node of inflorescence, each fascicle sub-
tended by a rudimentary If-stk bearing a patel-
liform nectary, each raceme without filaments 3-
4 mm diam. and its pliant axis, including short
2-bracteolate peduncle, 3-7 cm, the narrowly cb-
ovoid fl-buds glabrous; bracts membranous lance-
subulate 0,.2-0.55 mm, becoming brown decid-
uous; pedicels 0.1-0.45 mm; flowers 5-merous
all bisexual; calyx membranous cam-
panulate 0.5-0.7 mm, externally either glabrous
or puberulent, the deltate-triangular teeth 0.1-
0.3 mm; cerolla white (drying fuscous or black-
ish), turbinate 1.3-1.8 mm, the recurving lobes
0.7-0.9 x 0.5-0.7 mm, 1 -nerved; filaments white,
free to base, surpassing corolla-lobes by 1.2-2.5
(-3) mm; anthers ovate 0.45-0.55 mm; ovary
short-stipitate. Pods 1-3 per raceme, pliantly
pendulous, in profile linear-oblong, when well
fertilized (5-)5.5-10 x 1-1,7(-1.9) cm, (8-)9-
12(-14)-seeded, at base abruptly contracted into
a stipe (1-)1.5-4.5 mm, the straight or nearly
straight, either glabrous or puberulent, rarely
randomly aculeolate replum 0.3-0.5 mm diam.,
the thinly papery olivaceous- or fuscous-brown
valves low-bullate over each seed, dotted overall
with minute red scales and usually otherwise gla-
brous but rarely pilosulous overall, when ripe
breaking up (sometimes tardily and irregularly)
into free-falling, individually dehiscent articles
4-8 mm long; seeds transverse at middle of pod,
compressed-obovoid, in broad profile 3.74.6 x
2.5-3.1 mm, the fawn or castaneous testa smooth
sublustrous.
When Bentham first described M. myriadenia
(in the genus Entada) and M. punctulata he pos-
sessed of each species only one collection and
fruits of neither. It could not then be foreseen
that the obvious differences between them in fo-
liage would quickly be blurred by subsequent
collections and eventually merge into a contin-
uous range of variations in leaf-formula that is
associated with a uniform inflorescence and pod.
The variation in foliage between populations of
M. myriadenia follows a familiar pattern of re-
ciprocal adjustment between number of pinnae,
size of leaflets, number of leaflets, and distance
between successive pairs of leafiets along the pin-
na-rachis. In the long series of specimens now
available for comparison, the typus of punc-
rudata, with few pinnae and few broad, distant,
dorsally venulose leaflets stands at one end, and
those of taxonomically synonymous M/Z. longi-
caulis and M. myriadenia var. egena, with many
pairs of pinnae and very numerous, narrow and
crowded leaflets, at the other. On the upper-mid-
dle Amazon in eastern Loreto, Peru and in ad-
joining Brazil and Colombia plants of these ex-
treme types are sympatric and appear to behave
as distinct species. But outside the region of sym-
patry they are linked by indefinitely numerous
intermediates collectively referred in herbaria to
a heterogeneous Af, myriadenia. Five segments
of the full arc of variation correspond to the tax-
onomic varieties recognized herein, but there are
no perceptible discontinuities between them.

The discontinuous known range of var. dis-
persa@, partly within and partly to the west of var.
myriadenia, could be explained in two ways, nei-
ther ostensibly the more probable. The variety
may be of polyphyletic origin and consist of his-
torically independent but parallel modifications
derived from var. myriadenia. Or alternatively,
the dispersed populations represent a primitive
stock from which the other varieties of Af. myria-
denia have issued, var. egena by multiplication
of smaller leaflets and vars. myriadenia and
punctulata by progressive amplification and loss
of number.

Mimosa annularis Bentham, M. paniculata
Bentham (non aliorum) and M. xinguénsis Ducke,
all endemic to the Amazonian and Guianan Hy-
laea, are essentially alike except for leaf-formula
and reciprocal adjustments between size and
number of leaflets, and I here propose to treat
them as vicariant races of one species. So defined,
M. annularis differs from sympatric Af. rufescens
and M. guilandinae in development of persistent
setiform stipules and correspondingly stiff seti-
form paraphyllidia at base of each pinna-rachis,
and further in a pod about 8-10, not 17-33 mm
wide. The closest relative of M. annudaris is Mex-
ican and Central American Mf. watsonii B. L.
Robins., similar in form of stipules, paraphyllid-
ia and pods, but different in wide-mouthed foliar
nectaries,
Bentham, acquainted with only one fruiting
collection of Mf. annudaris and one single speci-
men of M. paniculata, distinguished these spe-
cies solely by leaf-formula. This has proved
somewhat variable, and there is no longer a gap
in the series of pinna- or leaflet-numbers such as
might support separation at the specific level.
Mimosa xinguénsis carries simplification of the
leaf and simultaneous expansion of leaflets a step
further than Af. annudaris, with leaf-formula al-
most stabilized at two pairs of pinnae and 2-3
pairs of leaflets. Because a small discontinuity
exists between maximum number and maxi-
mum size of leaflets in M4, annularis and M. xin-
guénsis, as recorded in the varietal key following,
the latter appears to stand a little further apart;
but the resemblance in ali other respects justifies
its reduction to varietal status.

yield surprises. The populations sampled in

Mimosa watsonii is the Central American an-
alogue of Amazonian AM. annudaris. It resembles
M. annularis in sharpty deflexed paraphyllidia
and in relatively narrow pod, but differs in cu-
pular, not narrow-pored leaf-nectaries and in dis-
tantly allopatric dispersal. Like Af. annudaris and
several related South American species, Af. wat-
sonii is subject to great variation in leaf-formula,
which Grether (1987: 321) interpreted as ran-
dom and of no taxonomic significance. While I
agree fully with Grether’s reduction of several
segregates to a comprehensive M, watsonii, it
appears to me useful to recognize the extreme
variations in leaflet-size and -number as named
varieties; for Grether’s criteria, if applied even-
handedly to the related South American com-
plexes of M. guilandinae, M. annularis, or M.
miyriadenia, would lead to an uncritical and far-
reaching sequence of reductions in rank.

This as yet seldom collected species resembles
M. annularis and M. watsonii in the reflexed,
setiform paraphyllidia at base of the pinnae, and
the first-mentioned more closely in the narrow
pod. It differs from A. annularis in the open-
mouthed tub-shaped, not flask-shaped and small-
pored petiolar nectaries, which are more like those
of the sympatric M. colombiana. From this it is
obviously different in 3-5-, not L-jugate, much
smaller leaflets of distal pinnae. The remotely
allopatric M4. watsonii has leaflets either much
larger when as few in number (var. waisonii) or
more numerous (to 5-9, not 3-5 pairs) when
comparabie in size (var. recordii).

Mimosa rufescens is closely akin to Af. gui-
tandinae sens. lat., from which it appears essen-
tially different only, although as a rule decisively,
in more numerous and smaller leaflets. Leaf-for-
mulae as low as iii-iv/4 (from Sa. dos Carajas in
Para, e.g., M4. F, F. da Silva 1311, NY) or ii-iv/
4-5 (from Loreto, Peru, Croat 17527, NY) meet
or overlap the range observed in M. guilandinae
var. spruceana, which is then only mechanically
separable by a characteristic pilosity of the leaf-
lets. It is theoretically arguable that Af. rufescens
is no more than a variety of M. guilandinae, or
even the generalized prototype from which AZ.
guilandinae arose through modification and sim-
plification of the foliage and through progressive
elaboration of the peltate trichomes. The geo-
graphic dispersal offers some support for this
view, for M. rufescens is dispersed over almost
the whole range of the several races of Mf. gui-
fandinae sens. lat. and might have given rise by
paralle] evolution to the paucifoliolate mimosas
here classified as units within M. guilandinae.
By chance it was the lowest extreme of leaf-
formula that was first discovered and described
as M. micracantha, a variant that has proved to
be elusive and highly localized in southwestern
Venezuela and adjoining Brazil, and that may
represent no more than a brief extension of the
curve of variation in leaf-formula manifested by
M. rufescens var. rufescens. Mimosa micracan-
tha (a posterior homonym) is here reduced to a
variety ammis-nigri of M. rufescens, but I am
very uncertain as to its biological significance.
Observation of whole populations is needed to
establish modes of variation in leaf-formula be-
tween individual plants at different stages of de-
velopment and between leaves of single plants
produced low and high on the vine. The ambig-
uous nature of the type of M. micracantha is
apparent from the fact that Bentham associated
it not with multifoliolate Af. rufescens but with
early collections of Af, guilandinae var. duckei
obtained on the Solimées and lower Madeira
rivers by Poeppig and Riedel.

Mimosa guilandinae, in the comprehensive
sense adopted herein, comprises five varieties
endemic to Amazonia and the Guianas that differ
among themselves principally in number, out-
line and indumentum of leaflets, and a sixth,
found in northwestern Colombia and Panama,
unlike the rest in patelliform, not mounded and
smail-pored leaf-nectaries. Each of the Amazo-
nian varieties was first described as a distinct
species, but their supposed diagnostic characters
have since turned out to be independently vari-
able, and discontinuities between them much
narrower than could have been foretold. Number
of petals (and consequently of stamens) is un-
certain in this species, the flowers of var. guilan-
dinae and var. spruceana being tetramerous, those
of var. extensissima almost always pentamerous,
and those of var. duckei either one or the other.
Rated by leaf-formula and indumentum, the vars.
guilandinae and spruceana appear relatively gen-
eralized, the rest exhibiting progressively fewer
and larger leaflets combined with these partic-
ular, scemingly specialized features: in var. cua-
trecasasii dilated and crowded scales on the hy-
pophyllum, in var. duckei stalked scales; in var.
extensissima exaggerated asymmetry of leaflets;
and in var. paterata the patelliform nectaries al-
teady mentioned.
The close relatives of M. guilandinae that oc-
cur within or at the edge of its range of dispersal
are three: 1) Mf. annularis, easily recognized by
sharply deflexed paraphyllidia at base of each
pinna-rachis; 2) M. colombiana, different in lig-
ulate stipules and larger capitula; and 3) the very
widely dispersed and common M. rufescens, es-
sentially similar in everything except for more
elaborate teaf-formula and prevailingly smaller
leaflets, and perhaps the direct progenitor of the
species. The line of reasoning invoked to justify
my broad definition of M. guilandinae would
seem to lead, granted only slight extension of
leaf-formula, to inclusion within Af. guilandinae
sens. lat. of M. rujescens on equal footing with
var. spruceana and var. duckei. When Ducke
described M. micracantha var. plurijuga, which
is taxonomically synonymous with MZ. rufescens,
he unwittingly proposed just such an extension,
for typical Mf. micracantha is none other than
M. rufescens var. amnis-nigri. The traditional
status of Af, rufescens is upheld on evidence of
dispersal, Whereas the varieties of M. guilandi-
nae are vicariant or only marginally overlapping,
as would be expected of taxa recently differen-
tiated from a common stock, Af. rifescens is
sympatric with all of them, its range being nearly
coextensive with that of M. guilandinae sens. lat.

Acacia guilandinae was tentatively referred by
Bentham (1876: 363) to the synonymy of Mi-
mosa obovata, which has grossly similar foliage
but trimerous flowers and no petiolar nectary. It
was thence transferred, without the qualifying
mark of interrogation, to Index Kewensis, where
it lay in abeyance until very recently. The epithet
guilandinae is the earliest applied to any member
of this group.
The variety is very close to middle-Amazo-
nian var. spruceana, differing principally in sup-
pression of plain hairs. It was first collected in
French Guiana by Aublet (BM!).

The var. spruceana differs from var. guilan-
dinae in pilosulous vesture and less accentuated
armament, but this can vary from branch to
branch on one plant. The leaflets of var. guilan-
dinae are commonly fewer by one pair, but this
difference is far from exact or constant.

The var. extensissima differs from var. duckei
in leaflets of all pinnae stabilized at one pair, in
sessile scales of the indumentum, in glabrous
flowers, and usually in more oblique, subfal-
cately half-ovate outline of the leaflets. Shape of
leaflets is, however, an unreliable criterion, for
the anterior margin varies from straight or shal-
lowly concave to shallowly convex, and the apex,
although most commonly short-acuminate, may
be broadly obtuse (Schunke V. 8308, NY). Al-
though described from Para, var. extensissima
has since been collected only in Peru and far
western Brazil, not less than ten degrees of lon-
gitude west of the type-locality, but this gap may
well be filled by future exploration.
In gross aspect var, extensissima mimics M.
extensa of Atlantic southern Brazil, but differs
in mounded (not dish-shaped) leaf-nectaries, pel-
tate (not verruciform) trichomes on mostly 4(—
5)-nerved (not 2-3-nerved) hypophyllum, small-
er capitula, and slightly shorter filaments,

Rudd compared M. cuatrecasasii with M. co-
dombiana and M. extensissima, which she mis-
takenly thought to lack scalelike trichomes. In
fact all three taxa have trichomes of the same
type, only they are so much larger and more
crowded in 4. cuatrecasasii as to impar1 a cop-
pery metallic gloss (reminiscent of Bauhinia cu-
preonitens Ducke) to the hypophyllum of the leaf-
lets. Except for the size and density of these scales,
vars. cuatrecasasii and extensissima are almost
identical, showing the same variation in leafiet-
outline and having in common all pinnae bifo-
liolate. Mimosa colombiana stands well apart
from this pair in having strap-shaped stipules,
openly cupulate leaf-nectaries, and considerably
larger capitula.

The var. paterata differs from all other vari-
eties of M. guilandinae in its patelliform (not
bottle-shaped) leaf-nectaries, but in other re-
spects scarcely differs from var. extensissima,
matching this exactly in the small capitula of
glabrous flowers, in ellipsoid flower-buds, and in
thinly lepidote hypophyllum of leaflets. The leaf-
nectaries resemble those of Af. colombiana, dis-
tributed eastward in Colombia from the Mag-
dalena valley into southwestern Venezuela, but
this differs substantially in larger capitula, sub-
globose-pyriform flower-buds, ligulate persistent
stipules, and a// pinnae precisely bifoliolate. Mi-
mosa watsonii, endemic to Central America
northward into southern Mexico, also has pa-
telliform nectaries, but differs in more numerous
leaflets and in particular in the pair of conspic-
uous deflexed paraphyllidia at base of each pair
of pinnae,
The syntypes of var. paterata, from Bocas del
Toro and Choco respectively, appear essentially
alike in nectaries and flower-buds. The unicate
specimen from northern Antioquia (Segovia, C.
Sandeman 5568, annotated by Sandwith as “sp.
nov, ?, near Af. K) differs in small-
er, cupular rather than dilated patelliform nec-
tary and somewhat plumper, but similarly gla-
brous flower-buds. Definitive identification of
these forms must be deferred until the fruits be-
come known. Mimosa lawranceana, very closely
resembling Sandeman's plant in foliage but found
at rather greater elevation in the Eastern Cor-
dillera, is for the present readily distinguished by
spicate partial inflorescences.

Mimosa extensa is readily recognized in its
region by prickly stems, leaves composed of one
to three amply bifoliclate pinnae, obliquely di-
lated half-cordate leaflets minutely lepidote be-
neath, and concave nectaries at base of petiole
and immediately below each pair of leaflets. It
is an outlier of the Amazonian group exemplified
by M. guilandinae.
All but two of several collections of M7. extensa
known to me are essentially uniform in leaf-for-
mula and pubescence, but Brade 19295 from base
of Furno Grande in southern Espirito Santo and
Burchell 2699 from Magé (near the north shore
of Guanabara Bay) are so anomalous that I feel
compelled to describe them as a taxonomic va-
riety.

Differences in leaf-formula between var. ex-
tensa and var. annae are of the same order as
those taken to distinguish taxa of the same group
in Amazonia. In the state of Rio var. extensa is
known by modern collections chiefly from the
Organ Mts., whereas the type-locality of var. an-
nae is on the plain between the Organs and
nabara Bay. It is troubling, however, that var.
extensa may also have occurred at or near Magé,
if the label of Se/low 2250 (cf. synonymy of var.
extensa) formerly at Berlin is to be believed. Ob-
viously new collections and field-studies of the
species are highly desirable.
The variety is named in memory of Anna Bur-
chell, who, following her brother’s suicide in 1835,
presented his invaluable herbarium to Sir Wil-
liam Hooker.

Specific characters of M. colombiana are
bladelike stipules, broad sessile patelliform leaf-
nectaries, and glabrous flowers with ascending
corolla-lobes. Lepidote indumentum is always
relatively sparse, more often brown rather than
red, and sometimes almost lacking. Union of the
filaments varies from a short collar below the
ovary to a tube surrounding it. The leaflets of
Davidse 13931 from S, Carlos del Meta are pi-
losulous beneath, unlike those of other collec-
tions, including one (Piedra Marimare, Wurdack

Mimosa lepidophora was likened in the pro-
tologue to M. annularis, but appears to me much
closer to M. rufescens, being very like this in leaf-
formula and indumentum, but different in loss
of prickles, no doubt related to its free-standing,
not vinelike life-form, in position of the petiolar
nectary well above base of leaf-stalk, in larger
flowers, and in relatively narrow pod (about 12—
14, not 17-33 mm wide). From the two other
Glanduliferae adapted to yearly periods of
drought in cerrado and caatinga climax associ-
ations it is more readily distinguished by more
numerous and smaller leafiets densely lepidote
beneath, in bearing the nectary near mid-petiole
and not close to or between the first pair of leaf-
lets, and in larger, tetramerous (not pentamer-
ous) flowers. The species links the elepidote free-
standing, almost or quite unarmed Glanduliferae
of the Brazilian Planalto to the lepidote-stellate
and prickly lianas of the hylaean forest.

Because it is the only representative of its group
occurring in upland northern Bahia, M. irrigua
should be recognized without difficulty, the pet-
iolar nectaries, small heads of white diploste-
monous flowers, and broad plano-compressed
pod combined with few ample leaflets being
characteristic. For appraisal of affinity see con-
spectus of ser. Glanduliferae above.
The four known populations of A/. irrigua dif-
fer in minor points, At Sento Sé, on Sa, do Tom-
bador, and on Sa. da Agua da Rega the petiole
proper is well developed, mostly 15-30 mm long,
and the stipules are setiform; while on Sa. do
Acurua the petiole is almost suppressed and the
stipules are shortly subulate. Both at Sento Sé
and on Sa. do Acurua the leaflets vary from gla-
brous to densely pilosulous on the lower face,
while further south the leaflets, so far as known
at present, are consistently glabrous on both fac-
es. Hatschbach 39566 (NY) from west of Morro

Within its range and environment M. pithe-
colabioides is the only mimosa that has petiolar
nectaries and spicate flowers. Within ser. Gian-
duliferae a lack of prickles and a free-standing,
fruticose or arborescent growth-form are notable
specific characters plausibly correlated with ad-
aptation to cerrado and campo mapestre habitats.
The only other spicate Gianduliferae are prickly
lianas, M. lawranceana of the northern Colom-
bian Andes, and a rare and abnormal form of
MM. rufescens known only from Para. The species
nearest to MM. pithecolobioides is the also free-
standing and almost unarmed Af. irrigua, en-
demic to the heights of Chapada Diamantina in
north-central Bahia; but this has the petiolar nec-
tary near mid-petiole and flowers in globose ca-
pitula,
Mimosa pithecolobioides is conspicuously
variable in pubescence of stems and foliage. The
glabrate state, corresponding to the species as
originally described and including the negligible
var. brachystachya, is now known from the
northern and southern points of the whole spe-
cies-range and randomly between them. The vil-
losulous state appears dominant in north-central
Minas Gerais, but not to the exclusion of the
glabrate one. The plants are otherwise identical,
and there seems no advantage to be had from
perpetuating a taxonomic distinction between
them. The manuscript epithet /asiogynum ap-
plied by Martius to the type of Mf. pithecolo-
bioides was a misnomer, the ovary at anthesis
being completely glabrous.

This superficially variable species appears in
Bentham’s revision (1875: 425, 427) under three
names: M. revoluta, M. gonociada and M. sora-
tensis. Only the first of these was credited with
petiolar nectaries, although in reality all are alike
in this respect. Granted the nectary, Af. soratensis
is essentially identical to M. revoluta. Mimosa
gonoclada was likened by Bentham to M, (An-
montana and distinguished from it chiefly
by deeply sulcate branches (a feature common
in M. revoluta) and scabrous or, as ] would term
it, densely setaculeate stems. Bentham inter-
preted this array of setaculei as aculei sparsi,
therefore significantly different in kind from the
usually three infranodal aculei of ser, Andinae.
But MM. gonoctada, of which the holotype is now
supplemented by Beck 7458 (NY) from prov.
Ayopaya, Cochabamba, has setaculei supple-
mentary to, not replacing, the primary nodal
prickles characteristic of revoluta, together
with its nectaries and coiled pods. This scabrous
form of M. revofuta, known only from the south-
ern edge of the whole range of the species, may
deserve some subordinate taxonomic rank, but
is emphatically not specifically distinguishable.

From its only known close relative, A4. town-

guished by the armament of cat’s-claw prickles

er, plumply ellipsoid capitula, and by subcentri-
cally costate leaflets. The type-collection, con-
sisting of 23 duplicates, was distributed as an

In petiolar nectaries both at tip of leaf-statk
and also in some leaves on leaf-stalk below the
first pair of leaflets, as well as in the tetramerous
flower, Af. townsendii seems closely related only
to M. nothacacia. From this it is strongly differ-
entiated by armature of geminate, immediately
infranodal, straight (not serially scattered unci-
nate) aculei, by tiny stipules and by displaced
midrib of leaflets. In general habit and in paired
cauline aculei it resembles some Andinae, but
these are all innocent of extrafloral nectaries and
have pentandrous flowers. Superficially M. we-
berbaueri appears most similar in leaf-formula
and ellipsoid flower-spikes, but this is otherwise
typical of Andinae.

Gentry (Rio Mayo PI. 128. 1942) has described
the habit and habitats of Af. palmeri, a species
distinguished by elaborately microphyllidious
leaves and slender flower-spikes. I have some
misgivings about the synonymy. coe-
focarpa was found on the coastal plain, rather
than in the sierra foothills, and has proportion-
ately narrower leaflets than typical A4. palmieri,
and a more deeply campanulate calyx (1.2-1.3,
not 0,5-0.8 mm). The observed differences seem
to fall short of the specific.

This seldom collected mimosa seems related
guatemalensis and M. dysocarpa, and near-
er the former in leaf-formula, but may be rec-
ognized by a peculiar growth-habit and rhythm
of anthesis, by lack of interpinnal spicules, by
thicker denser flower-spikes, and by relatively
long calyx-teeth, The mature summer foliage has
yet to be collected.

The complezly variable M, polyantha perhaps
represents the matrix from which evolved M/.
distachya. \t differs from M. distachya sens. lat.
most obviously in more numerous and smatler
leaflets, but further from var. distachya, where
sympatric on the Pacific coast, in glabrous flow-
ers, and from both this and the more northern
var. /axiflora, like it in glabrous flowers, in po-
sition of the primary cauline aculei next to, not
displaced below, the nodes. Mimosa distachya
var. oligacantha, however, while different in few-
er leaflets and in dispersal, has similarly situated
cauline prickles, and consequently distinction
between M. polyantha and MM. distachya at the
specific level is open to challenge and needs cor-
roboration. Plants of M. polyantha that bear their
flowers on brachyblasts, accompanied by or only
succeeded by relatively short leaves, differ greatly
in general aspect from those that bear flowers on
long-shoots, when each spike is subtended, and
sometimes surpassed, by a longer primary leaf.
This dual aspect and variation in indumentum
of the pod account for most of the synonymy
listed.

As here interpreted, Af. distachya is a poly-
morphic species of bicentric dispersal, in desert
and seasonally drought-stressed brush-wood-
land, about the western shores of the Caribbean
and on the Pacific slope in Mexico, where it ex-
tends to Baja California and northward through
the Sonoran Desert into southwestern Arizona.
Tt is very closely related to the alse polymorphic
M. polyantha, which is mostly vicariant in up-
land interior southern Mexico, but sympatric with
M. distachya in Sinaloa. Mimosa potyantha
scarcely differs from M. distachya except in more
numerous and smaller leafets, and is equally
variable in indumentum of the pod, while fewer
and larger leaflets, reduced to one or exception-
ally two pairs per pinna, alone distinguish the
also closely related Af. rosei. Specimens (Purpus
3179, NY) ambiguous between M]. polyantha and
M. distachya have been collected on the Puebla-
Oaxaca boundary, and these populations (left un-
classified herein), which may perhaps include the
type of M. brevispicaia Britton, require close
scrutiny in the field.
Four varieties of Af. distachya are defined be-
low. The var. ofigacantha, distinguished princi-
pally by stout infrapetiolar aculei arising im-
mediately below each node and not downwardly
displaced onto the internode, is geographically
detached. Its leaves are finely pubescent except
sometimes ventrally, its flowers are sessile, and
its short-stipitate pod is both pubenilent and re-
motely or randomly hispid with a few erect se-
taculei. The vars. distachya and laxiflora are geo-
graphically vicariant along the coastal plain and
foothills of western Mexico and morphologically
confluent. Collectively they may have either gla-
brous or puberulent foliage, cither sessile or ped-
icellate flowers, and pods either glabrous or pu-
berulent and in addition either
hispidly setose or not. The var. laxiflora is ar-
bitrarily set off by a combination of glabrous
foliage, racemose flowers, smooth pod, and dis-
persal within the Sonoran Desert east and north
of the Gulf of California. The variation in the
residue is discussed briefly under var. distachya.
The var. chamelae, apparently confined to coast-
al Jalisco and Colima and adjoining Michoacan,
has a fruit entirely compatible with var. distach-
ya, but differs in relatively ample leaves, long
pinnae, and large, incipiently revolute leaflets. In
aspect it suggests Mf. guatemalensis, but the leaf-
let-venation and broader, less prominently bul-
late craspedium agree with M. distachya sens.
Jat. It may deserve specific status.

in Regio horto Matritensi mensibus Augusto
et Septembri specimen so la-
belled in herb, Cavanilles. (MA! = F Neg,
29424) is not dated, but is presumably the
cultivated plant described and figured in the
protologue, and would serve as lectotypus.—
Tt seems likely that the plant was raised from
seeds provided by Sessé & Mociiio, and these
may perhaps be from their plant described by
DeCandolle as Acacia prosopoides (q.v., sequ.).
Bentham, 1875: 417, equated M. distachya with
M. oligacantha, but the fatter is not known
from Mexico. Except that Cavanilles’s plant is
unarmed, it agrees best with the western Mex-
ican plants called Af. fuertensis, M. setigera,
and M. ferrisiae by Britton & Rose (1928); the
lack of aculei in a young cultivated plant would
not be surprising.

Bentham equated M. oligacantha with M., dis-

immediately below the nodes and not on the
internodes is a distinctive quality of all speci-
mens seen. Similarly situated aculei are com-
mon, however, in A4. polyantha, which could be
considered an element of an extended M. dis-
tachya.

Mimosa rosei is certainly nearly akin to Af.
distachya and M. polyantha, and is perhaps de-
rived from the former by reduction of leaf-for-
mula and reciprocal dilation of leaflet-blades.
These vary considerably in maximum size, but
I readily follow Mc Vaugh in recognizing only one
taxonomic entity.

In Ancash M. weberbaueri is sympatric with
M. montana, but readily distinguished by larger,
more elaborate leaves with aculeate leaf-stalks
2-7 (not 0.3-1.2) cm long, and by the aculeate
replum and articulate valves of the pod. It is the
only known member of its group yet discovered
in Amazonas. In segregating Af. dichoneuta,
Macbride emphasized (Fl. Peru, p, 85, in clave)
puberulent flowers and leaflets pubescent on both
faces as differences from weberbaueri as then
known. However the type of M. dichoneuta has
an essentially glabrous corolla, and that of MM.
weberbaueri has leaflets thinly puberulent above.
The fruits seem identical. A modern collection
from near Chachapoyas (Ferreyra 710.2, MO)has
slightly mere numerous pinnae and leaflets than
the material studied from Ancash, perhaps a re-
flection of a less austere climate, but I can find
no substantial ground for recognizing two spe-
cies.

Mimosa andina resembles the Peruvian MM.
montana in few pinnae per leaf, but differs in
leaflets twice as large and a consequently different
aspect. It is confined to a small stretch of the
central Ecuadorean Andes in latitude 2°-3°S.
From the vicinity of Quito northward into south-
ern Colombia it is replaced by the closely related
M. quitensis, different in higher leaf-formula and
much smaller leaflets. The flowers and pods of
these Andean mimosas are similar in form, hav-
ing preserved the ancestral traits of their com-
mon predecessor while the foliage, always labile
in Mimosa, underwent modification in size and
number of parts.

Mimosa montana and M. andina are here con-
strued as vicariant sibling species that share a
much reduced leaf-formula but differ consis-
tently in amplitude of leaves and leaflets. The
typical form of M4. montana, recorded from Ca-
jamarca south to Ancash, has extremely small
and narrow leaflets combined with a shallow ca-
lyx much less than half as long as the corolla.
Three collections from Piura, described below as
var. sandemanil, differ in a deeply campanulate
calyx and mostly broader leaflets, features that
suggest passage toward Ecuadorean M. andina.
Further collections may demonstrate that the two
species are confluent in northern Peru. Smaller
simpler leaves alone distinguish M. montana
from closely related M. weberbaueri.

pods. In leaf-formula it is like Af. galeottii, but
lacks the armament of hispid setaculei. Young
flowering specimens are likely to be sought among
the tasselled ser. Leiocarpae, but the close rela-
tionship of the species to so-called Mimosapsis

the convex abaxial suture and narrowly gaping

The broad definition of Af. aculeaticarpa em-
bodied in the foregoing description is only mar-
ginally more comprehensive than that proposed
by McVaugh (1987: 198-200), who has ably
demonstrated the continuous modes of variation
that link the smaller- and simpler-leaved plants
of the Mexican Plateau and southwestern United
States (=M. diuncifera of modern authors) with
the often taller, more amply and more elabo-
rately foliate plants of tropical Mexico known to
Bentham as M. acanthocarpa and more recently
either as aculeaticarpa or M. rhodocarpa.
From the small sample then available, Bentham
(1841-1842) in his first revision of Mimosa spoke
of Af. biuncifera as “perhaps too close to A4.
acanthocarpa, but looks different’; this different
look has become increasingly difficult to partic-
ularize as more is learned about variation be-
tween populations. Independently of the foliage
characters the fruits vary considerably in length,
width, curvature, and in armament and depth of
constriction of the replum, while independently
of the pod the fiowers vary from densely gray-
puberulent to glabrous. At the periphery of the
whole range of Af. aculeaticarpa sens. lat., for
example in the northern Chihuahuan Desert, in
Sa. Madre Oriental, and in Chiapas, the known
populations are relatively stable morphologically
and have perceptible individuality; but on the
slopes of the Transverse Volcanic Range in Mex-
ico the characters that contribute to a distinctive
syndrome in the peripheral populations appear
in random combinations, from which no stable
formula can be extracted. The problem presented
by these forms cannot be solved in a herbarium
study, and I therefore present here only a ten-
tative outline of one possible classification, leav-
ing for the future a detailed intraspecific one. For
the same reason I propose no changes in the
nomenclature, except in the case of Ad, biuncif-
era, for which an appropriate combination is re-
quired for the United States flora. Nevertheless
I regard the four variants, with their clusters of
synonyms, as equivalent in taxonomic status to
varieties recognized elsewhere in this work. The
key that follows mirrors the major trends in the
complex, but does not accommodate all the mi-
nor variants known in nature. It must be borne
in mind that smail specimens thai show only
inflorescences or only young growth may mislead
as io the real dimensions and leaf-formula of
mature foliage.

fore supposed to be derived from seed, or progeny
of seed, sent to Spain by Sessé, the origin being re-
corded by Lagasca (1816) as Nueva Espafa. Plants
were grown under Willdenow’s name also at Copen-
hagen (Hornemann, Hort. reg. hafn. 449, 1813) and
at Dresden (Reichenbach, Iconogr. bot. exot. 47, tab.
63) before 1825. Reichenbach's colored figure shows
flowers as well as pods. His description, in which he
traces the plant’s origin to Tenerife in the Canary
Islands (a way-station from Mexico), calls for leaves
attaining 7.5 cm, lfts 6 x 2 mm, and a pod 50 x 8
mm, displayed in the figure as irregularly falcate and
constricted (much as the pods in herb. Willdenov.).
The leaves are comparable to those shoots

ternodes with a solitary recurved infrapetiolar
one, the young stems, foliage, and usually the
aculeate If-axes pilosulous with soft erect-as-

facially glabrous ciliolate or pilosulous on both
faces, the globose capitula axillary to coeval Ivs
on hornotinous branchlets. Stipules papery
brownish 2-6(-12) mm, usually ligulate obtuse,
incurved and 2-3-nerved distally, or some lower
ones ovate, rarely the longer ones attenuate sub-
setiform. Leaf-formuda v-ix(-xii)/(7-)9-1 7(-20),
the lf-stks (3-)3.5-1 1 cm, the ventral sulcus con-
tinuous (spicules 0), the pinna-pairs seldom ex-

nule, the moderately displaced midrib pinnately
2-3-branched on each side, the inner posterior

venulation becoming prominulous and pallid in
age. Peduncles solitary and 2—3-nate, (1-)1.5-3.5
cm; capitula without filaments (6-)7-9.5 mm
diam., moriform, the fl-buds either glabrous or
pilosulous, the clavate receptacle 1.5-4 mm long;
flowers 5-merous 10-androus, sessile or almost
so, all bisexual; calyx narrowly campanulate
(1.2)1.5-2.2 mm, the minute teeth 0.1-0.2 mm,
sometimes tipped with a reddish granule, the or-

or contracted at base into a stipe to 2 mm, in
profile narrowly oblong to linear, straight or gent-
ly decurved, x 4,5-7 mm, 3-8-seed-

0.5-2.5 mm, the stiffly papery, dark brown, ves-
tigially puberulent but often densely granular
valves low-umbonate over seeds, when ripe fall-
ing from replum in one piece.
In the context of its group M. grahamii is dis-
tinguished by relatively ample leaves and by
prominulous dorsal venulation of the leafiets. In
the typical variety the pod is relatively short and
broad, with replum not or scarcely constricted,
and provides space for the seeds to lie obliquely
across the cavity. In the habitally identical Af.
protifica, which is here considered only varietally
distinct, the longer narrower, undulately con-
stricted pod confines the seeds to an essentially
vertical orientation, The pubescence of foliage
and flowers varies notably between populations
of M. grahamii, but the less common glabrate
form occurs entirely within the range of its pu-
bescent counterpart, and intermediates between
the extremes (noted as numerous by Kearney &
Peebles, Arizona Flora 401. 1970, but denied by
Isely, 1971b; 418) make precise definitions dif-

Mimosa tacerata rather closely simulates M.
aculeaticarpa in most respects, but differs in the
shorter calyx, the exaggerated armature of the
pod, and further from tropical montane Mexican
forms of that polymorphic species in bimodal
branching pattern, providing for vernal flowers
from brachyblasts and summer foliage from long-
shoots. A similar winged fruit, in which the se-
taculei of the replum are greatly dilated at base
and confluent into jagged margin, has developed
in lowland M. bahamensis, but is there accom-
panied by a distinctive indumentum and !eaf-
formula. Since its description nearly a century
ago the pod of lacerata has been found to
vary considerably in length of stipe, in width of
body, and development of the marginal wings,
of which the component setaculei are sometimes
found partly or largely separate to the base, as
in the type-collection of Mimosopsis glutinosa.
From the material seen, much of which lacks
mature fruits, it appears that the typical broad,
long-stipitate and continuously broad-winged pod
is prevalent from the Tehuacan Desert south-
and southwest-ward, and the narrower, often
shortly stipitate and less emphatically winged or
only strongly setaculeate pod prevails northward
from Puebla into Querétaro, but is also present
at the margin of the Tehuacan Desert M.
glutinosa). The intraspecific variation requires
systematic study in the field of the spring and
summer aspects of each population,

brachyblasts minutely whitish-puberulent, the
small subglobose capitula arising with Ivs from

The plant described above was distributed as
M. grahamii, but appears more closely related
to M. aculeaticarpa var. biuncifera, of which it
may even be an extreme xeromorphic form. Nor-
mally, the capitula of M. aculeaticarpa are borne
exclusively on coevally expanding long-shoots,
whereas here all are produced from hemispher-
ical brachyblasts on annotinous branchlets. Fur-
thermore the calyx is shorter than normal in even
the smallest, most xeromorphic expressions of
var. biuncifera. Cajeme (now Ciudad Obreg6n)
is situated on the floor of the Sonoran Desert in
the lower Yaqui valley, in the Foothills of Sonora
zone as defined by Shreve & Wiggins (1964, vol.
1, map 1); typical var. biuncifera is a typical el-
ement of grassland at levels well above the So-
noran Desert. The fruit is required for taxonomic
evaluation.

According to Britton’s note on the clastotypus
at NY, Robinson doubted that it belonged to
Mimosa, but the pod is essentially similar, except
for somewhat thicker replum, to that of AZ. gen-
iryi and M. barrancana, and flowers collected at
Alamos by R. Grether are those of an unexcep-
tional Mintosa. Apart from the longer pod, con-
sisting of individual segments dilated lengthwise
and separated by deeply recessed isthmi, Af. mo-
atliformis differs substantially from Af. barran-
cana only in slightly more numerous pairs of
pinnae and leaflets. In the material from Alamos
the capitular receptacle is globose or claviform,
not over 2 mm long; in the one specimen from
San Bernardo (Pennell 19713, NY) it is elongate
to 1 em, and the capitulum in consequence be-
comes ellipsoid.

The type-collection of M. gentryi was misiden-
tified by Standley (in herb.) as lindheimeri A.
Gray, but was not mentioned as such in Gentry’s
report on the plants of Rio Mayo. A later col-
lection (Gentry 6594, NY) from Sa. Surutato was
distributed as Af. pringiei. While this last is cer-
tainly of the same group, the truly close kindred
of M, gentryi are M. barrancana and M. monit-
iformis, vicariant south- and north-ward respec-
tively low on the Pacific slope of Sa. Madre Oc-
cidental. From each of these Af. gentryi differs
in abbreviated leaf-stalks and few pinnae. The
only shallowly constricted ped is almost that of
M. barrancana. Mimosa pringiei, a species na-
live at the lower edge of the oak-forest on the
east slope of Sa. Madre, has similar leaf-formula
but differs greatly in stiff xeromorphic life-form
and hispidulous flowers.

The foregoing description includes characters
of two closely related taxa that are vicariantly
dispersed along the east foothills of Sa. Madre
Occidental, either in grassland or in the lower
oak-belt, one (4. pringlei sens. str.) in central
Chihuahua, the other ranging from southern Chi-
huahua into Durango. While intuitively recog-
nized as different, owing principally to disposi-
tion of the upper leaves, their technical
descriminatory characters are weak or overlap,
and I therefore class them provisionally as va-
Tieties of M. pringiei. Their status requires field
study.

Ihave been unable to associate the type of 47.
zimapanensis with any modern collection. It re-
sembles M. pringlei var. pringlei in aspect and
in fusiform flower-buds, but differs in glabrous
flowers. At first sight it suggests Af. texana var.
Jiipes, but the aculei are infrastipular, not infra-
petiolar. Zimapan, the type-locality of record, is
well-known botanically, but has not yielded con-
firming specimens necessary for interpretation,
and the locality may be a mistaken one. In the
present state of uncertainty, Mf. zimapanensis can
be associated only provisionally with M. pringiei.
Bentham may have seen more complete material
in herbarium at Dublin, as the proto-
logue indicates a somewhat higher leaf-formula
than shown on the small Kew specimen, which
consists of the tip of a flowering branch.

As described for the species and modified by
key to varieties.
In unknown habitats, but to be expected in
seasonally deciduous matorral near 1500-2200
m, known only from s. Puebla and n, Michoacan,
Mexico,—Fl. VI-VIIL.
Pringle described his plant from Michoacan as
a small tree. The status of this variety will need
reassessment when the fruit is known, but at an-
thesis it can scarcely be distinguished from var.
texana.

Mimosa arenosa resembles in many respects
the partly sympatric 7. tenuiffora, which differs,
however, in resinously glandular foliage, hooded
calyx- and corolla-lobes, and viscid-glandular pod
bullately distended over each seed. Like M. fen-
uiflora, and for no more pressing reason, the
Present species has been known by different
names in its widely dissevered areas of dispersal
north and south of Amazonia, but the hazy dis-
tinctions in form of inflorescence and propor-
tions of flower-parts by which Bentham (1875:
416) distinguished a Brazilian M. malacocenitra
from a Venezuelan VW. arenosa can no longer be
maintained. Most Venezuelan populations of var.
arenosa have slightly longer (0.5-0.8, not 0,35-
0.5 mm) and therefore more deeply campanulate
calyces, but I have found no supporting differ-
ences,
Alike in Venezuela and Brazil the leaflets of
M. arenosa vary from glabrous ciliolate to pu-
bescent on both faces, but the modes of variation
are different. In Venezuela the two types are er-
ratically sympatric, both occur commonly around
Caracas, and have been collected together in Lara
(Pittier 13095, NY). In Brazil pubescent leaflets
seem to occur only locally in north-central Minas
Gerais and are commonly accompanied by cau-
line aculei curved upward, of a type foreign to
the species elsewhere. I recognize this form as a
weakly differentiated var. /ysalgica.
In arid northeastem Colombia and north-
western Venezuela the species is represented by
plants of a slight!y anomalous type to which the
name M. leiocarpa has been applied. Bentham
(1875: 416) maintained this provisionally as a
species but admitted to an inexact memory of
the typus, collected at Sta. Marta by Bertero. He
thought that Af. leiocarpa might be separable from
M. arenosa by greater number of pinnae and
glabrous foliage, but these distinctions have lost
cogency in the course of time. We now know that
the leaf-formula on Sta. Marta is quite plastic
and, as already noted, glabrous and villosulous
forms of M. arenosa are sometimes sympatric
and otherwise identical. Nevertheless M. /eio-
carpa does differ from typical 14. arenosain some
small features of the foliage and may appropri-
ately be maintained as a third variety. Disjunct
populations of Af. arenosa in southern Pacific
Mexico seem also to belong here.

Mimosa hapaloclada was compared in the
protologue with 4f. apodocarpa, which is clearly
different in dorsally gland-dotted leaflets, white
filaments, and essentially sessile, gland-sprinkled
and much broader pod. In general aspect and
most details M. hapatociada resembles allopatric
M. arenosa, which has similar membranous leaf-
lets and eglandular vesture together with a slen-
der stipitate pod; but the latter has scarcely half
as many pairs of pinnae, commonly glabrous (not
corolla, and white (not pink) fila-
ments.

Until the pod is discovered, the status of AZ.
dichroa in relation to M. acutistipuwia will remain
uucertain. The coarser foliage, the thick-tex-
tured, faintly and simply costate leaflets, the long-
exserted panicle, the usually pink filaments, and
the pilosulous ovary and puberulent corollas pro-
vide for the present a seemingly strong differ-
ential syndrome, but each individual difference
is of small weight in itself, and will require re-
evaluation when the pod is known. Mimosa di-
chroa also resembles M. interrupta in leaf-for-
mula, but differs in lack of prickles, no resinous
exudate, and externally pilosulous flowers with
more deeply campanulate calyx. Here again the
fruit may eventually provide stronger contrasts.
Mimosa apodocarpa and M, xavantina, aiso sim-
ilar in gross facies, have leaflets gland-sprinkled

Mimosa ophthalmocentra and M. acutistipula
are sympatric over much of the former's range,
both are white-flowered and eglandular, and in
consequence they have been much, but need-
lessly, confused in herbaria. At anthesis the te-
tragonal, narrowly campanulate corolla with
erect, apically hooded and dorsally keeled lobes,
and, later on, the sessile pod infallibly distinguish
M. ophthaimocenira. While M. ophthalmocentra
tends to have fewer pairs of pinnae and fewer
leaflets per pinna, the leaf-formulae overlap and
do not provide reliable criteria.
Typification of M4. ophthalmocentra proved
unexpectedly difficult. Five specimens,
variably labelled and numbered, are preserved
at Munich, all annotated as M. ophthalmocentra
in Bentham’s hand, These appear to represent
three collections at least, and two species, of which
my analysis seems worth recording:

Mimosa dalyi resembles M. insignis in sym-
metrically 3-nerved leaflets and plump submo-
niliform pod with broad replum, but differs
greatly in leaf-formula, rufous-lepidote flowers
and pink filaments. The form and basipetal ori-
entation of the seeds are effects of constraint from
the pod walls.

Among Leiocarpae this species is strongly
characterized by very numerous, crowded, finely
but sharply trinerved leaflets and by white flow-
ers giving rise to narrow moniliform, bluntly te-
tragonal pods with replum as wide as or a little
wider than the valves, which break into excep-
tionally long, narrower articles. The Bolivian
M. dalyi is alone like it in pod-structure, but this
has more than twice as many pinnae, leaflets
more faintly trinerved, minutely rufous-lepidote
flowers, and pink filaments. The curious story of
Schranckiastrum, based on misinterpretation of
the pod’s replum as persistent entire valves and
of its valves as a disarticulating replum, has been
recounted elsewhere (Barneby, 1984).

Asyndrome of viscid foliage, strongly 4-ribbed
calyx with incurved lobes, and a stipitate thin-
walled pod charged with mixed sessile and stip-
itate glands, the valves bullately distended over
the seeds, neatly defines this widespread species.
The Brazilian populations, which were ascribed
by Bentham to an endemic species, M. hostilis,
differ only very slightly from those of Venezuela
by leaves on the average a little shorter and com-
posed of fewer (mostly 4-7, not 6-11) pairs of
pinnae; but some individual plants from these
widely disjunct areas are nevertheless identical
in foliage. Stipitate glands are perhaps more fre-
quent north than south of the Equator, but are
imperfectly correlated with dispersal.
In recent years tepescohuite has received sen-
sational publicity as a miracle drug in the treat-
ment of burns. It is said to be harvested in Chia-
pas in great quantities.

has the pod of M. apodocarpa, but the larger

This attractive catkin-mimosa was first de-
scribed as a variety of the distantly related hap-
lostemonouos M. millefoliata, and later reinter-
preted by a link between M. apodocarpa
and M. dostilis (=M. tenuiflora of this account).
The two latter are members of the same section,
but both allopatric and specifically distinct, M.
apodocarpa differing in deeply campanulate ca-
lyx and hispidulous, not resinous corolla and M.
tenuiflora in structure of both calyx and corolla
and in the thin-teatured bullate stipitate-glan-
dular pod, The species most closely akin to Mf.
glutinosa appears to be Af. interrupta, similar in
minutely gland-punctate leaflets and glabrous
resinous flowers. From this it is readily distin-
guished at anthesis by the pallid branchlets and
in fruit by the characteristic pod, not planocom-
pressed as that of M/. interrupta but suberously
thickened and mounded over each seed.

The type of M. spixiana was misidentified by
Bentham as A, interrupta; it is clearly different,
however, in absence of pilosulous indumentum,
elongate stipules, low leaf-formula (as given in
Latin diagnosis) and corolla thinly gland-sprin-
Kled but not resinous. The leaflet-venation sug-
gests affinity to Af. sericantha, but in this case a
higher leaf-formula with proportionately smaller
leaflets coinciding with flowers only thinly glan-
dular but not gray-pilosulous are decisively dif-
ferent. The fruit, when discovered, will perhaps
provide stronger clues to its affinities.
The species is named in honor of the Bavarian
zoologist Johann Baptist von Spix, Martius’s
companion in Brazil in the years 1817-1820 and
co-author with Martius of the magnificent Reise
Brasilien.

Mimosa puberula differs from all spicate Mex-
ican mimosas other than M. tenuiffora in dor-
sally gland-dotted leaflets, and from this in partly
pentamerous flowers, minute erect, not cucul-
lately incurved calyx-teeth, and simply pilosu-
lous, not pilesulous and glandular ovaries. The
pod, when discovered, may provide further dif-
ferential characters. The type is unarmed, but it
would be no surprise to learn that older branches
are armed like those of Af. tenuiflora. Whether
pentamerous or tetramerous flowers prevail in
the species will bear on interpretation of the af-
finities of the species, at present indecipherable.
If the locality at Zimapan, near 1800 meters on
the Gulf slope of Sa. Madre Oriental, is correct,
the ecology of the species must be very different
from that of M. tenuiflora, which enters Mexico
from the south only in lowland thorn-scrub in
Pacific Chiapas and Oaxaca. Mimosa puberula
is here provisionally referred to ser. Leiocarpae.
No compatriot spicate species appears at all close
to it.

Mimosa pteridifolia was the first described
member of a group widespread in planaltine Bra-
zil and locally disjunct in Venezuela. The name
is here restricted to plants with relatively broad,
marginally revolute and consequently dorsally
concave leaflets, and with no spicules between
pinna-pulvinules. So defined, it is the dominant
member of its immediate group in highland Goids
and adjoining Mato Grosso and is known so far
from only one station in Minas Gerais, where it
is otherwise replaced by M. gemmutata var. gem-
mulata,
Bentham’s concept of Af. pteridifolia included
from the first an element of gemmulata. As
collections have accumulated, the heterogeneous
nature of Af. pteridifolia sensu Bentham has be-
come more evident, and dispersal patterns of its
constituent parts have emerged. The variation
has been analyzed in part by Rizzini (1980), who
recognized four varieties. One of these is equiv-
alent to M. gemmudata of this account. The var.
affinis Rizzini was mistakenly described as acu-
leate. The holotype of var. paucipinnata shows
only some upper leaves which, as often happens,
are simpler than primary cauline leaves present
in the isotype at NY (pinnae to 12-jug.!).

Mimosa adenophylia is closely akin to M. pte-
ridifolia, from which it differs in some combi-
nation of these characters: prickly stems, spicules
between some distal pairs of pinnae, fewer (4-
12, not 9-24) pairs of pinnae in larger feaves,
ampler leaflets (to 4-9, not 3.5—-5 mm long), and
dispersal at usually lower elevations along and
eastward from rio Francisco. Prickly stems
alone readily distinguish both var. adenophytia
and var. armandiana from all M, pteridifolia,
and few (4-7) pairs of pinnae the unarmed var,
mitis. So far as known, interpinnal spicules are
diagnostic for M. adenophylia sensu lato. The
also related Af. gemmuiata is represented in the
range of M, adenophytia, but mostly at greater
elevations, by two varieties, easily separable in
practice by very small plane leaftets mostly less
than 4 x 1.5 mm.
The known populations of M. adenophylla are
diverse in detail. They seem to fall into three
groups deserving taxonomic status.

scarcely lustrous testa brown or mottled.
Various forms of M. gemmulata were encoun-
tered before 1850 by Blanchet, Pohl and Martius,
but the species lay concealed within a loosely
defined M. pteridifolia until partly extricated in
1980 as var. nanophyila Rizz. From the closely
related AM. pteridifolia it is readily separable by
smal] plane-margined, nearly always narrower
leaflets, by small spicules between all or most
pairs of pinnae, and by an inflorescence leafy at
anthesis, It also has prevailingly smaller stipules
and a pod (not well known, however) minutely
puberulent rather than pilosulous between the
array of sessile goiden glands. Morphological
variation in M. gemmuiata is correlated with
dispersal and permits recognition of five varie-
ties.
The epithet gemmulata refers to the gemlike
glands that pave the lower face of the leaflets.

longer leaflets no more than 2.5 mm long, An
example from Grio Mogol (CFCR 9670) sim-

from southeastern Minas Gerais (Glaziou 12643,

This is a generally well marked entity, differing
from var. gemmulata in greater stature at ma-
iurity, ampler, relatively long-petiolate leaves,
and more numerous, usually longer leaflets. The
pod, known as yet from only one example, ap-
pears distinct in its stipe and in incipient aculeoli
of the replum, which is perfectly unarmed in
other forms of the species. The type-collection
of var. adamantina contributed to the protologue
of M. pteridifolia.
Four collections (NY) from municipio Cris-
tdpolis in west-central Bahia are referred pro-
visionally to var. adamantina, but may deserve
independent status, They are remarkable for
stems and leaf-stalks charged with fimbriolate or
substellate setulae, in EAC 72360 many and to
1,5 mm long, in EAC //36/ fewer and less than
1 mm, and in Hatschbach 39486 and EAC 3702
shorter still (medusiform) and easily overlooked.
The fruit is sessile, and the articulation of the
valves much delayed.

The var segrex, remotely isolated from the main
Brazilian range of M. gemmudlata, is intermediate
in leaf-formula between var. gemmulata and var.
adamantina, and seems not to differ further from
either except in the longer denser pubescence of
more erect hairs. It has passed in Venezuela as
M. trianae, a Colombian mimosa fundamentally
different in dense stellate indumentum of hy-
pophyllum and corolla, and in white filaments.
The trans-Amazonian disjunction between var.
segrex and other varieties of 44. gemmulata has
a parallel in Senna macranthera var. quadrifo-
fiolata (Pittier) I. & B., which is closely sympatric

While I entertain no doubt as to the close af-

uneasy about its status as a distinct species. The
long narrow leaves composed of very numerous,
crowded pairs of abbreviated pinnae furnished
with as many as 20-26 pairs of minute crowded
leaflets are visually arresting, but could be inter-
preted as an extreme modification within M.
gemmuiata sensu Jato, Reassessment of its tax-
onomic rank is best postponed until the fruit
becomes known.

Mimosa fiebrigii has the foliage and in partic-
ular the pubescence, composed of erect plain hairs
and sessile spherical, brilliantly translucent gold-
en glands, of Af. gemmutata and its immediate
allies, all native far to the east of Paraguay and
collectively different in their inflorescence of loose
amentiform spikes. The dense ellipsoid capitula
of M. fiebrigii recall sympatric Paraguayan M.
rojasti, but this has striately several-nerved floral
bracts and stipules characteristic of a distantly
Telated group. The also Paraguayan M. uliginosa
and MM. glanduliseta have broadly comparable
capitula, but differ in armature of the stems, pin-
shaped glandular setulae and the dilated para-
phyllidia of ser. Stipetiares. Despite its con-
densed ellipsoid capitula, M. fiebrigii is referred
with confidence to ser. Leiocarpae.

In cerrado, attaining 760 m; described from a
plant collected by C. F. P, von Martius, suppos-
edly in October, 1818, near Caiteté, close to the
Atlantic-Séo Francisco divide at +14°S in s.-
centr. Bahia, but known precisely in modern times
only from the valley of rio Carinhanha, on the
Bahia—Minas Gerais border at +45°45’W.—Fl.
VII-IX(7X).
Mimosa coruscocaesia seems to be a special-
ized derivative of M. gemmutata, remarkable in
ser. Leiocarpae for plumose and substellate set-
ules. Because of these trichomes, Bentham mis-
identified the type-collection as Af. (ser. Lepi-
dotae) cylindracea, which is eglandular and has
yellow, haplostemonous flowers. The flower of
M. coruscocaesia is diplostemonous and the fil-
aments, of an indeterminable color in the type,
are now known to be pink. The plumulose setules
that clothe the stems and leaf-stalks of 44. co-
ruscocaesia are of a rusty-brown or yellowish hue
that contrasts with the soft dove-gray tomentu-
lose indumentum of the leaflets’ upper face. The
epithet refers to the contrast between the blue-
gray upper and the gland-encrusted lower faces
of the leaflets.
Rediscovery of M. coruscocaesia at 760 m el-
evation in transfranciscan Minas Gerais, and not
on Chapada Diamantina from which the type
was reported by Martius, raises a question about
the accuracy of Martius’s label. The field data
that appear on some Martius collections are
known to be either vague or actually misleading.
The species is reported (1989) by Pereira Neto
to be common along rio Carinhanha near
45°45'W, and therefore must have lain in the
path of Spix and Martius on their journey from
Malhada on the Sao Francisco west to Chapada
do Parana in September of 1818. Until its oc-
currence in south-central Bahia is confirmed, M.
coruscocaesia may be considered probably en-
demic to the Carinhanha valley along the com-
mon border of Bahia and northwestern Minas
Gerais.

A bushy treelet of rapid growth, ornamental
in flower, the long pliant tassels of pink filaments
forming.a pleasing contrast with the gray foliage.
In the material examined there is considerable
variation in size of leaves and leaflets. The larger
leaflets are commonly about 5-7.5 x 2-3.5 mm,
but can attain 9-12 x 44,5 mm, a variation
probably due to conditions of shade or moisture.
Over most of its range the calyx of Mf. verrucosa
is pubescent with simple hairs, but one collection
from Chapada do Araripe in Ceara (Castellanos
& Duarte 533, BRADE, NY) has a stellately lep-
idote calyx and a few stellae on the tip of the
corella-lobes. This may possibly represent an in-

An elegant tree with finely divided aromatic
foliage and ample panicles of white flowers, Af.
schomburgkii is, in South America north of the
Hylaea, the only mimosa—other than allopatric
(Colombian) M4. trianae—with flowers at once
spicate and densely stellate. A full account of its
relationship to closely related A/. artemisiana is
given by Heringer & Paula in the protologue of
the latter. The Honduran plant has long been
accepted as typical M. schomburgkii, and was
thought by Record to be native there. The iden-
tity of the populations in Pernambuco is some-
what ambiguous. These have the relatively small
flowers of genuine M. schomburgkit, but leaflets
with the relatively long basal auricle that char-
acterize herbarium specimens of M. artemisiana.
Field study and analysis of wood-structure in the
light of data secured by Heringer & Paula are
required to settle the taxonomy.

This is a handsome tree of rapid growth, with
ample panicles of white, honey-scented flowers.
In the protologue it was distinguished from dis-
tantly vicariant but morphologically similar 14.
schomburgkii, grown side by side with it over a
period of twelve years under cerrado conditions
at Brasilia, principally by features of petiole- and
wood-anatomy, but the longer corollas and lon-
ger basal auricle of the leaflets are more readily
accessible differential characters. Kuhlmann (s.7.,
RB) noted that the bruised foliage of Mf. schom-
burgkii cultivated at Rio de Janeiro was resi-
nously scented, a fact noted also by Ducke (1222,
NY) at Manaus, whereas that of M. artemisiana
was scentless. In material studied 1 could not find
any pentamerous flowers as indicated in the pro-
tologue of 14. artemisiana; I think they must
occur only sporadically in this species, as they
do in M. schomburgiai. The epithet artemisiana
commemorates Dra. Maria Artemisia Arraes
Hermans.

Mimosa trianae is very closely related to .\f.
schomburgkii, differing most obviously in the
densely tomentulose lower face of the leaflets,
less decisively so in slightly higher leaf-formula
and somewhat smaller leaflets. The flowers and
fruit are essentially identical and the two species
might perhaps be better treated as geographical
varieties of one. The Venezuelan report (Fittier,
1927: 68) from the state of Lara is based on a
collection (Jahn 2193, US) of M. gemmulata var.

5—7 mm long; seeds rhombic-elliptic in wide pro-
file, 3.7-5.5 x 3-4 mm, strongly compressed,
the testa dull fawn-olivaceous girdled by fuscous
margin.
In its Brazilian range the well-known M. bi-
nsucronata varies little. Some herbarium speci-
mens, due to the size of the inflorescence, include
only depauperate leaves at or near base of the
panicie, which may give a misleading picture of
the potential leaf-formula, Others show only un-
armed branchlets, but aculei are believed to be
regularly present on some part of the plant. The
status of the Paraguayan var. adenocarpa, in
which the Ifts appear at once fewer and much
wider, remains uncertain, but it is provisionally
retained here in order to stimulate further stud-
ies. Burkart interpreted var. adenocarpa (in an-
notation of Fiebrig 4770, P) as equivalent to AZ.
hexandra, but its flowers are tetramerous and the
immature pod shows no sign of suberous thick-
ening.
The abundant, sweetly fragrant white flowers
of M. bimucronata are a source of honey, and its
hard wood is used in carpentry and cabine1-work.
Its long-established use in southeastern Brazil as
a hedge is acknowledged in Bentham’s epithet
sepiaria. It is used in folk-medicine (Pio Correa,
1931) to treat asthma and intermittent fevers.

Mimosa pseudosepiaria, first collected near
Joazeiro by Martius in 1819 but not described
untit long afterward, is a critical entity, closely
akin to Adm. bimucronata, hexandra and exal-
bescens, all of which are known to occur in low-
land Bahia, and especially to Mf. hexandra, which
has been collected with it around Remanso and
Petrolina. It differs from M. bimucronata in the
reduced foliage with fewer, simply costate and
on the average smaller Seaflets; from Af. exal-
bescens by much narrower pods (4.5-6, not 8—
10 mm wide); from M. hexandra primarily in
thin-textured craspedium; and from the two last
collectively in mostly tetramerous, not trimerous
flowers. However, in all members of the group
some intraspecific variation in number of flower
parts has been observed, and I am perhaps over-
weighting the character in this context. It seems
certain, however, that the bisexual flowers of M.
bimucronata and M. pseudosepiaria are regularly
tetramerous and only some smaller staminate
ones trimerous, whereas all are trimerous in M.
hexandra and M. exalbescens.

Mimosa exalbescens has the (normally) stipi-
tate plano-compressed craspedium of Af. bi-
mucronata and the trimerous flowers of A4. hex-
andra. It is intermediate between them in leaf-
formula and obviously closely related to both. A
substantially wider pod and strongly two-nerved
leaflets separate it from M. pseudosepiaria, which
has also the mostly tetramerous corollas of M.
bimucronata. The whitish bark of annotinous
branchlets is a striking but perhaps unimportant
feature of the specimens seen.

Mimosa hexandra is very closely related to M.
bimucronata, but differs usually in all, and al-
ways in some combination of these characters:
smaller leaves, more deeply cleft puberulent ca-
lyx, mostly or wholly trimerous corollas; but es-
pecially, as first pointed out by Burkart (1948,
in the suberous valves of the pod. While the
valves of the pod are always much thicker than
those of M. bimucronata, their mode of dehis-
cence has proved to be less constant than ex-
pected by Burkart. In some the whole pod breaks
transversely across both valves and replum in
the manner of a loment, but in others the valves
alone separate into free-falling articles and the
replum persists. A study of the distribution of
these modes of dehiscence is hampered by lack
of ripe fruiting material.
Other close relatives of M4. kexandra are M.
exalbescens and M. pseudosepiaria, which see for
comment.
The fragmented range of 44. hexandra poses a
problem in interpretation. Its immediately close
kindred are all East Brazilian, and it seems rea-
sonable to suppose that it arose as a xeromorphic
derivative of M. bimucronata, acquiring in the
process a reduced leaf-formula, a mostly trim-
erous flower, and a modified pod, all relatively
advanced characters. It is, however, at present
most abundant by far in the upper Paraguai val-
ley, and occurs in Atlantic Brazil only very lo-
cally in northern Bahia and states adjoining to
the north. Because M. bimucronata is found, but
less commonly, in Paraguay, M. hexandra might
have arisen there, even by independent muta-
tion, The populations in northern South America
and Mexico seem certainly to be derived from
south of the Amazon, but whether they migrated
thence by savanna pathways during episodes of
forest decline or reached their contemporary
habitat in xeromorphic scrub-woodiand by ac-
cidents of long-distance dispersal is impossible
to determine,

Floral features peculiar to M. Jewisii in the
context of its group are hemispherical capitula,
deeply campanulate, irregularly lobed calyx, long
corolla, and stout filaments scarcely twice as long.
The species is randomly variable in the distri-
bution, length and density of excretory glands,
which may be stemless or elevated on a setular
stalk to 3 mm in length, and either massed along
the new stems or confined to the ventral ribs of
the leaf-stalks. There seem to be no significant
differences between the populations found on the
coastal lowlands and those of the upland interior.

This poorly known mimosa resembles M. bi-
mucronata in habit and especially in the exserted
panicle of small white capitula, but differs in leaf-
lets approximately half as many and twice as
broad, dull on both faces and paler beneath. It
is perhaps as closely related to the also inade-
quately known A. catharinensis, which differs in
leaflets yet fewer and larger and in restinga hab-
itat on the coast of Santa Catarina, and is in
addition said to be sarmentose. Mimosa parai-
dana of northeastern Brazil, very similar to
cubatanensis in leaf-formula, differs in arma-
ment of recurved scattered (not infrastipular ac-
roscopic, in some branches wanting) prickles,
largely leaf-subtended rather than paniculate pe-
duncles, a shorter calyx, and pink filaments.
Dimensions of leaflets given in the foregoing
description are taken from the specimens stud-
ied; according to the protologue they may be a
little longer and substantially wider, attaining 10—
12 x 6-8 mm. Flowering branches of the plant
cultivated at Brasilia are unarmed.

to M. bimucronata, but has fewer and broader
leaflets. These resemble leaflets of Ad. cubata-

fewer; and the armament of recurved rather than
acroscopic prickles, perhaps related to a scandent
growth-habit, is decidedly different.

Bentham saw only indifferent specimens of Af.
caduca, and referred the species to his ser. Lep-
tostachyae next to M. guatemaiensis, describing
the capitula as oblong spikes. The capituta are
now known to vary at full anthesis from plumply
ellipsoid to subglobose, and are very similar to
those of Af, (Andinae) andina, except that most
flowers are tetramerous rather than pentamer-
ous. Moreover the fruit of M. caduca is not pseu-
dofollicular like that of its pentamerous neigh-
bors in the Andes but an ordinary craspedium
prevalent in ser. Birmucronatae. Although at first
sight a relationship to Andean species of com-
parable growth-habit and dry tropical-montane
ecology seems more plausibie than kinship to
morphologically similar but remotely allopatric
Mexican, Brazilian or Antillean ones, I find no
technical grounds for excluding M. caduca from
ser. Bimucronatae. In its Andean context M. ca-
duca is readily recognized by conspicuously bi-
colored leaflets, convex and shiny dark green
(when dry, brown) above and pallidly silky-pi-
losulous beneath.
Mimosa xerophytica is certainty synonymous
with M. caduca. The type-localities lie close to-
gether on the Ecuador—Peru boundary, and the
type-specimens are in close accord.

Aithough not seen in flower, this obviously
distinct mimosa is confidently assigned to the
circle of affinity of which M. bimucronata is the
best known member. Its relatively few and large
leaflets are characteristic, most nearly ap-
proached in size and number, within the group,
by distantly allopatric Af. catharinensis. From
sympatric Af. hexandra it differs not only in fo-
liage but in the papery craspedium.

benaceae.

Mimosa domingensis is the coarse trailing or
sarmentese member and M. diplacantha the
dwarf or bushy microphyllidious member of a
closely related pair of species endemic to His-
paniola, the names of which have long been con-
fused. The identity of the first is known from the
surviving holotypus of Acacia domingensis DC.
The holotypus of Af. diplacantha, now destroyed,
was available to Urban at Berlin in his studies
of Antillean Mimosa, and at one point (1920:
259) he explicitly associated it with Rose & al.
4018 from Azua, a specimen of the dwarf species,
Taking into account Urban’s powers of minute
observation I regard this as powerful indirect
proof of the identity of Af. diplacantha, borne
out, furthermore, by the protologue. Urban,
however, identified this material as Mf. domin-
gensis. In consequence, the true M. domingensis,
as new collections from Hispaniola reached Ur-
ban in Berlin and Britton in New York, was nat-
urally thought to be undescribed. Its unarmed or
weakly armed states were distinguished as M.
mornicola by Urban and as M. azuensis by Brit-
ton & Rose, and the strongly armed state as Af.
buchii by Urban and as M. farisii by Britton &
Rose.
A peculiar feature of both 44. domingensis and
M. diplacantha is the variable number of sta-
mens, the 4—5-merous flowers varying from fully
diplostemonous to exactly haplostemonous, but
most falling somewhere between the two. Adi-
mosa mornicota and M. buchii, which Urban had
described as having four or five stamens per flow-
er, were for this reason narrowly interpreted by
Britton & Rose as members of sect. Eu-mimosa
and transferred from their natural position next
to M. fagaracantha in sect. Habbasia to a spe-
cially provided ser. Mornicolae in sect. Eu-mi-
mosa.
lam indebted to Dr. T. Zanoni for identifying
Buch’s “‘Morne in Haiti, type-locality
of Af. mornicola.
The isotype of Af. duchii that survives at
Kingston, Jamaica is now somewhat fragmen-
tary but seems to consist of the tips of flowering
branches and consequently does not show any
primary stem leaves. The largest leaves on the
specimen have four pairs of pinnae, which sug-
gests M. feonardii, but the leaf-stalk is not dilated
as in that species.

Mimosa ekmanii differs from closely related
M. domingensis in leaf-formula and in dispersal.
Its pods are described both by Urban and by
Britton as unarmed, but almost all examples seen,
including the isotypus at NY, in fact have a few
prickles scattered along the midrib of the replum.
The typus of Af. moaénsis, consisting of sterile
pieces of what Shafer described as “creeping
shrubs, forming large has essentially the
foliage of M. ekmanii and appears to be no more
than a growth-form of the same species.
The status of M. apieura is uncertain. Bassler
(1985, key) considered it distinct from typical
ekmanii in slightly more numerous and slightly
narrower leaflets, and in a slightly narrower pod,
but the measurements overlap. I have found in
east-Cuban material of M@. ekmanii leaf-formu-
lae of (1-)2-4(-5)/4-8 and leaflets 1.8-3.7 mm
wide. The corresponding figures for 14. apleura
are “3(-5)/6-8(-9)" and “1-2 The differ-
ence in pod-width given by Bassler is 6-8 mm
in M. ekmanii and 5-7 mm in MM. apleura.

Shrubs resembling sympatric M. extranea in
habit but the If-stks Jess dilated and the devel-
oped pinnae more numerous (in these characters
resembling Af. domingensis), armed at the nodes
and immediately below the pulvinus of each pin-
na with stout recurved fuscous acu/ei 2-4 mm,
the young stems and peduncles minutely puber-
ulent and granular, the thick-textured Ifts gla-
brous, the globose capitula 2-3-nate in axils of
expanded lvs. Stipules erect subulate 0.4-0.8 mm,
tardily deciduous, Leaf-stalks (2-)4-6 cm, the
petiole and one or two interpinnal segments each
+2-2.5 cm, dorsiventrally compressed but shal-
lowly concave ventrally, not evidently or weakly
ribbed, each broadened upward and becoming
1-1.5 mm wide; pinnae 2-4-jug., the rachis 5-
13 mm, either unarmed or occasionally 1—2-acu-
leate below distal pair of Ifts, the interfoliolar
segments mm; lfts accrescent up-
ward, the first pair 1-2 mm distant from pulvinus
(paraphyllidia obsolete), the blades broadly el-
liptic from semicordate base, rounded apically,
the distal pair 6-8 x 34.5 mm, 1.3-1.75 times
as long as wide, the venation immersed on both
faces, the midrib and 1 posterior nerve some-
times faintly discolored dorsally. Peduncfes 7-8
mm; capitula globose, prior to anthesis mori-
form, the sessile fl-buds puberulent; bracts mi-
nute caducous; flowers 4—-5-merous, 5-6-an-
drous; calyx campanulate 0.5-0.7 mm, minutely
toothed, finely puberulent externally; corolla vase-
shaped 1.8-2.3 mm, the spreading ovate lobes
0.7-0.9 x 0.6-0.7 mm, when five, two irregularly
coalescent; filaments whitish, free, exserted 2.5—
3mm; ovary puberulent. Pods (as deduced from
marcescent repla) subsessile, linear falcate +45
x 6 mm,
In habitat not recorded, to be expected in dry
brush-woodland associated with or near to M.
extranea, known only from the type-locality near
Ennery, dép. de l'Artibonite, I-I(-?).
The type-collection of 4. feonardii differs
markedly from M. extranea, which was collected
nearby, also by E. C. Leonard, in normally pin-
nate leaves and narrower, but still obviously
transversely dilated leaf-stalk. The leaflets, though
fewer in number, are almost those of Af. domin-
gensis, and it seems possible that Af. /eonardii is
described from an individual hybrid domin-
gensis x extranea. While M. domingensis is
widespread in Haiti, it is not yet recorded from
the immediate neighborhood of Ennery, Obser-
vation of M. leonardii in the field is needed to
clarify its taxonomic status.

Bentham saw only a small branchlet of this
curious Haitian endemic and, probably not aware
that it is a shrub of considerable stature, mistak-
enly associated it with the weak herbaceous M4.
paucifolia and M. phytiodinea native to the Bra-
Zilian Planalto. It appears certain that 4. extra-
nea is related closely and directly to compatriot
Fagaracanthae such as AM. domingensis, to which
it is firmly linked by Af. feonardii. Loss of leaflets
and compensatory expansion of the leaf-stalk has
occurred independently in se many genera of Le-
guminosae, both woody and herbaceous, that it
would be absurd to accord it generic recognition
in the absence of supporting characters. Thus,
Haitimimosa is one of Britton’s less felicitous
proposals; H. extranea has flowers, fruits and
even random foliaceous leaves entirely typical of
Mimosa.

When Rudd established the synonymy of in-
sular M. bahamensis and continental M. hemien-
dyta she plausibly suggested that the species was
aboriginally native to Mexico and only intro-
duced (though obviously long established) on the
Bahamas, its absence from Cuba being otherwise
inexplicable. While I agree that the species, so
strongly characterized by rufous indumentum and
remarkable crested fruit, is not taxonomically
divisible, the populations in the two main areas
of dispersal are not identical. The material stud-
ied in detail was sorted without difficulty into
two series, as follows:
a. Lfts of distal pair of pinnae (3-)4-6-jug., near-
ly always glabrous facially; stipe of pod 0-3
mm, Bahama Is.
a. Lfts of distal pair of pinnae 6-9-jug., com-
monly but not invariably puberutent facially,
stipe of pod 3-9 mm, Yucatan Pen.
If the Bahaman populations are indeed second-
ary, they are at least beginning to undergo evo-
lutionary selection, and a case could be made for
segregation at some infraspecific rank.
The epithet kemiendyta (half-clothed) refers to
the often bicolored indumentum of stems and
leaf-stalks, which are rufous on the shady side
and early blanched where exposed to sun.

Mimosa casianoclada has the stiffly fruticose

and tetramerous flowers that characterize M. far-

the same latitude and southward, but differs from
both in smooth purplish-castaneous branchlets

The minute foliage, which expands with or im-
Inediately after the capitula, recalls in size and
leaf-formula that of Andean Af. montana; but
this is eglandular, has infrapetiolar (not infras-
tipular) aculei, a spicule between pinna-pairs, and
pentamerous (not tetramerous) flowers.

Arborescent shrubs 2-5 m armed on random
internodes of stiffly flexuous, terete but obtusely
ribbed branches with a solitary, gently recurved
infrastipular aculeus 2-6 mm, appearing gla-
brous but the young growth and inflorescence
minutely puberulent and reddish-granular, the
lvs dark green subconcolorous glabrous, the glo-
bose capitula either solitary or 2-3 together, ei-
ther in axil of coeval lvs or on short lateral
branchlets, almost never on scaly brachybiasts.
Stipules appressed to stem, narrowly subulate 0.5—
1 mn, either deciduous or persistent. Leaf-staiks
including pulvinus 1-9(-11) mm, rounded dor-
sally, openly sulcate ventrally, the sulcus bridged
and vestigially spiculate at apex; pinnae 1-jug.,

mm distant from minute papilliform paraphyl-
lidia, the blades narrowly oblong obtuse, the larg-
est 5-8(-9) x 1.5-3 mm, 34.2 times as long as
wide, all nerveless ventraily, faintly 1(-2)-nerved
dorsally, the almost immersed midrib subcentric
beyond mid-blade, the posterior nerve obscure

out filaments 6-8 mm diam., prior to anthesis
moriform; bracts linear-spatulate or -oblanceo-

turbinate-campanulate 1-1.8 mm, the tube of
thinner texture below the sinuses than below the
lobes, these obovate or obtusely triangular 0.2-
0.3 mm, dorsally convex and puberulent; corolla
whitish, narrowly vase-shaped 3.3-3.8 mm, the
ovate acute l-nerved lobes 1,1-1.3 mm); fila-
ments white, shortly monadelphous around stipe
of ovary, exserted 3-3.5 mm. Pods essentially as
those of AM. detinens but the body (acc. Burkart)
attaining 8 cm in length and the seeds to 7.

A close affinity between Af. ostenii and M. de-
tinens was demonstrated in Burkart’s revision,
to which I can add nothing of substance. The
flexuous stems, greener and on the average coars-
er foliage and the somewhat larger capitula (with-
out filaments 6-8, not 4.5-6 mm diam.), com-
bined with a distinctive disjunct area of dispersal
make identification of M. ostenii an easy matter.

In cerrado and campo rupestre, on sandstone

Geral do Parana and Sa. dos Pireneus in s.-centr.
Goias (lat. +15°30'-16°S), Brazil.—Fl.
I-V.
While M. echinocaula was first seen in a form
with stems setose but otherwise glabrous, all
modern collections from Sa. dos Pireneus have
glabrous leaflets but villosulous stems and leaf-
stalks, and one of them has stems alternatively
densely hispid and esetose on different plants.
One collection from north of Formosa has the
long setae of the type but both stems and leaves
are gray-villosulous, The variation in the two
elements of indumentum appears capricious and
taxonomically inconsequential.
Bentham’s report of M. echinecaula from Ba-
hia is based on errors of labelling and interpre-
tation. Luschnath’s specimen (BR, hb. Mart.!),
which was annotated by Bentham, is labelled
Macahé and dated to 1833, a year spent by
Luschnath to Urban, 1906) within the
state and city of Rio de Janeiro. Macahé is pre-
sumably either the river or the serra of that name
(now Macaé) that drains or forms part of Sa. dos
Orgios, The plant is certainly M. echinocaula,
but is in all probability mismatched with the
ticket, as happened all too often in the Martius
herbarium. No other known specimen of
echinocauia is attributed to Luschnath, and the
species has been found in modern times only on
the crest of the Planalto in Goias, in climax cer-
rado or campo rupestre, an environment mark-
edly different from the heights of the Organ
Mountains. If not rejected out of hand, the report
of M. echinocaula based on Luschnath’s speci-
men must be received with skepticism until
proved correct.

Herbs and subshrubs of rapid growth and early
maturity, when young often appearing mono-
carpic but potentially soft-woody in age, the dif-
fuse, ascending or (when crowded) leaning and
scrambling, pith-filled stems (0.5—)1-2.5 m, usu-
ally densely, sometimes remotely armed along
the (4-)5 continuously prominulous stramineous
nibs with sharp recurved, stramineous brown-
tipped acuiei to (1-)1.5-3(-3.5) mm and usually
also + villosulous with fine erect-spreading Aairs
to mm, exceptionally glabrous, the
dorsal rib of If-stks and axes of inflorescence sim-
ilarly prickly, the bicolored, dorsally pallid, thin-
textured Ifts from villosulous on both faces to
minutely ciliolate but facially glabrous, excep-
tionally glabrous overall, the short-pedunculate
globose capitula at first axillary and much sur-
passed by the subtending If, some later ones be-
coming pseudoracemose. Stipules narrowly lance-
attenuate or setiform, sometimes a little dilated
at base, 2-6(-7) x 0.25-0.6 mm, often reddish,
1-nerved dorsally, sometimes subtended by a pair
of prickles, persistent. Leaf-sta/ks of primary
cauline lvs (4-)5-10.5(-12) cm, the petiole
(1,.5-)2.5-7 em, commonly about as long as or
longer than the rachis, this 2-5.5 cm, its longer
interpinnal segments (3—)4-8(—10) mm, the ven-
tral groove interrupted between pinna-pairs by
an erect-ascending spicule; pinnae of middle Ivs
or ofall lvs below inflorescence 4-8(-9)-jug., very
sensitive and in most herbarium specimens de-
flected and folded back-to-back behind If-stk, the
rachis of tonger ones 1.5-—3.5(—4) cm, the longer
interfoliolar segments mm; Ifts of
Jonger pinnae 17-28-jug., the first pair 0.3-2 mm
distant from unequal paraphyllidia, the exterior
member of these 0.6-1.6, rarely 2.5 mm, the ft-
blades in outtine linear-obiong or linear, sub-
acute or apiculate, those near mid-rachis 2.5—6(—
7) x mm, 4-5.5 times as long as
wide, all veinless above, beneath faintly 1(-2)-
nerved from pulvinule, the subcentric midrib very
slender, often merely discolored, the posterior
nerve when present short or obscure. Peduncles
1-3 per node, commonly geminate, 5-16(-20)
mm; capitula without filaments 4-5.5(-6) mm
diam., prior to anthesis moriform; bracts elliptic-
oblanceolate 0,4-1 mm; flowers normally 4-,
rarely and randomly 5-merous, diplostemonous,
either all bisexual or a few lower ones staminate;
calyx campanulate 0.2-0.4 mm, glabrous, the rim
entire or obscurely denticulate; corolla narrowly
turbinate or vase-shaped 1.7-2.4(-2.8) mm, the
membranous ovate concave 1-nerved, reddish
or sometimes green lobes 0.5-0.9(-1) x 0.4-0.65
mm, either glabrous or thinly hispidulous exter-
nally; filaments pink, very shortly or obscurely
monadelphous around base of ovary, exserted
(2-)3-5 mm. Pods usually 10 or more per capit-
ulum, crowded into a dense umbelliform cluster
close against the stem, sessile, in profile oblong
or linear, straight or gently decurved, usually
x 3-4.2(-5.5) mm and (2-)3-8-
seeded but in Mexican var. odibilis 40-70 mm
long and 12-16-seeded, the replum 0.4-0.6 mm
wide, densely aculeate along dorsal and
Jateral ribs with either erect or decurved prickles
0.4-1.3 mm, the papery valves usually villosu-
lous and either overall or only over each seed +
densely setaculeate, sometimes simply setacu-
leate, when ripe breaking into free-falling, indi-
vidually dehiscent, rhombic or almost square ar-
ticles 3-3.5 mm long; seeds compressed, in broad
profile rhombic or ovate 2.3-3 x 1.4-2 mm, the
testa pale or rich brown, lustrous.
In the context of its immediate group, diag-
nostic characters of M. diplotricha are relatively
long leaf-petioles coinciding with very short ax-
illary peduncles, 4-8 pairs of pinnae crowded
along an axis no longer, often shorter than the
associated petiole, and the fertility of most flow-
ers of each capitulum, the pods forming a dense
umbellate cluster. Varieties of Af. quadrivaivis,
similar in prickly stem and shortly pedunculate
capitula, are easily mistaken for Af. diplotricha
before the characteristic fruits begin to take form;
but the common South American element of this
group, M. quadrivalvis var. leptocarpa, may be
known even at anthesis by relatively few (2-4,
not 4-9) pairs of pinnae in largest leaves, and the
less widespread var. tetragona by petioles shorter
longer) than leaf-rachis. Rare forms of M.
diplotricha with only few and scattered prickles
resemble M. gracilis var. invisiformis, endemic
to highland east-central Goids, but in this each
capitulum bears only one or two fertile fruits,
Other ctose relatives are: supravisa, which has
fewer broader leaftets and longer pods with sim-
ply villosulous (not setose) valves; M. selici, with
subterete rather than sharply pentagonal stems,
only 2-4 pairs of pinnae per leaf, and stipitate
pods; and A4. suburbana, like the last but with
trigonous stems. In North America and the An-
tilles, where M4. diplotricha may not be primi-
tively indigenous, it has only one close native
relative, M. pinetorum, with only one pair of
pinnae per leaf. Care must be taken, however, to
distinguish Af. diplotricha from Mexican and
Central American members of ser. Quadrivaives,
for which fruits at least in formative stages are
almost indispensable.
Mimosa diplotricha is an invasive, prolific, fast-
growing, and with few exceptions formidably
prickly weed, rich in minor variations of stature,
leaf-formula, pubescence, and armament. All its
common forms are serially armed along the ribs
of stem and leaf-stalk with sharp cat’s-claw acu-
lei, but occasional individuals (e.g., Schunke 1115
from Hudnuco, Peru, NY) show only a few scat-
tered cauline prickles and unarmed leaf-stalks.
A completely unarmed form invisa fma iner-
mis Adelb.), first noted in Papua New Guinea,
ts now cultivated for cover and forage in the East
Indies and tropical Africa, and is the subject of
agronomic studies and breeding programs. No-
table Brazilian variants are represented by
Hatschbach 34279 from Goiads (NY), which has
peduncles to 26 (not 5-14) mm jong, and by W.
R. Anderson 8803 from Minas Gerais (NY), with
abnormally stout pods attaining 32 x 5.5 mm,
An outstanding Mexican form with pods twice
as long and seeds twice as many as in normal Ad.
diplotricha is described below as var. odibilis.

Mimosa supravisa is compared in the diag-

which it resembles particularly in serially acu-
leate stems and leaf-stalks, and there shown to
differ in few pinnae, fewer larger leaflets, and a
pod retroaculeate on replum but simply villo-
sulous on the valves. In their common Brazilian
range these two species are further differentiated
by length of pod and number of seeds, these
mostly 3-8 in Af. diplotricha and 8-14 in M.
supravisa, In habit of growth and in leaf-formula
M. supravisa closely approaches Af. maraca-
yuénsis and some forms of polymorphic grac-
itis. It differs from M. maracayuénsis in armed,
not setose stems, and from the randomly armed
M. gracilis var, invisiformis in prevailingly less

The only closely related mimosa known to oc-
cur on the Atlantic slope of Serra do Mar within
the range of Af. seffoi is the weedy Af. diplotricha,
clearly distinct at anthesis in 4-7 (not 2-3) pairs
of pinnae in larger leaves and in leaflets all much
less than 2 mm wide; and in fruit by the sessile
pods only 3-5 (not 6-7) mm wide and hispid
(not glabrous) facially. Mimosa supravisa, vicar-
iant to the west, differs in sharply ribbed stems,
only 7-14 (not 15-20) pairs of leaflets on the
longer pinnae, and a facially villous (not gla-
brous) pod about 4 (not 6-7) mm wide. Mimosa
selloi and M. suburbana of the Brazilian Federal
District are similar in leaf-formula and stipitate
pod, but the stipe in suburbana is about 4.5—
6 (not 2-2.5) mm long, the stems are sharply
trigonous, the capitula are only 3-4 (not 4.5—-5)
mm in diam., and the leaflets of longer pinnae
are 23-31 not 15-20) pairs.
In revising Argentine Mimosa Burkart (i948:
97) mistook M. gracilis var. leiocarpa for M. sel-
foi, but corrected the error in Flora itustrada

The protologue of M. pinetorum gives no hint
of its relationship or probable place in the genus,
but Standley can have seen no complete flower
and therefore was unable to refer the species to
either of Bentham’s sections Habbasia or Eu-
mimosa. In superficial aspect M. pinetorum sug-
gests some form of Af. pudica with simply con-
jugate pinnae, but its stipules are setiform one-
nerved, the leaflets lack the coarse marginal setae
of sect, Eu-mimosa, and spent flowers of the
isotype at MICH prove to be diplostemonous.
The species appears to be a geographically iso-
lated member of sect. Batocauion related to the
aculeate Paucifoliatae. Among these it is unique
in reduction of pinnae to one pair, although this
feature recurs among unarmed Paucifoliatae in
the case of Brazilian M4. diptera. Mimosa pine-
forum also bears a suggestively strong likeness
to M, (ser. Cordistipulae) piscatorum, which is
perhaps artificially separated on account of trim-
erous flowers. The type of Mf. pinetorum differs
further, however, from M. piscatorum, known at
present only from Venezuela and northeastern
Brazil, in somewhat ampler leaflets, tonger pet-
ioles, and glabrous pod-valves, but all these char-
acters could prove variable when M. pinetorum
becomes better known.

gracilis is a polymorphic aggregate that consists

hairless to residually puberulent. Each series is
highly variable (but not in precisely the same
mode) in leaf-formula and consequently in am-
plitude and outline of the individual leaf. Except
in minor details of no taxonomic value, the iow-
ers and fruits are extremely uniform. A century
ago Bentham possessed not more than thirteen
collections of this group, several of them incom-
plete, which he disposed of in three species: a
glabrous M. filiformis; and pilosulous AM. gracilis
and M. capillipes, the last composed of three
varieties supposedly different in numbers of pin-
nae and of leaflets per pinna, These differences
are real enough, but are now seen not as discrete
character-states but as marking random points
on a continuous curve of variation.
Analysis of the leaf-formula in Af. gracilis has
demonstrated that, while number of leaflets per
pinna is relatively conservative or even stabi-
lized within a population, it is otherwise with
number of pinnae per leaf-stalk, which tends to
vary not only from plant to plant but from leaf
to leaf upward along the stem. Increased number
of pinnae commonly accompanies diminished
length of true petiole, as though accessory pairs
of pinnae had been added along the petiolar seg-
ment of the leaf-stalk. I here deemphasize num-
ber of pinnae per leaf and reorganize the now
extensive material, whether glabrous or pilosu-
lous, primarily by length of pinna-rachis and
number of leaflet-pairs. Because size of leaflets
varies independently of number and of conti-
guity along the rachis it is not taxonomically use-
ful in this complex.
The dispersal of the three subspecies of ./.
gracilis is peculiar. The known ranges of the two
more populous ones, subspp. capillipes and filt-
formis, are almost coextensive, except that the
jatter is proportionately rarer on the Brazilian
Planalto but becomes more frequent southward.
The subsp. gracilis occurs entirely within that of
subsp. capilfipes except that it extends to Para-
guay, and it is vicariant with subsp. capillipes
only in Brazil, in the Federal District and the
Triangulo Mineiro. These facts of dispersal, so
far at variance with what is commonly expected
of subspecies, suggest that the major categories
that I have defined in M4. gracilis sens. lat. are
not phylogenetically homogeneous, but assem-
biages of parallel independent mutations from a
common predecessor. If so, they are taxonomic
artifacts, categories of convenience.

The var. capillipes varies substantially in leaf-
formula and length of pinnae not only between
populations but sometimes also serially from leaf
to leaf along the stem, which in favorable cir-
cumstance may extend more than a meter from
the rootstock, becoming progressively less leafy
distally, Number of leaflets per pinna and length
of pinna-rachis are poorly correlated, but size
and number of leaflets, whether on longer or
shorter pinnae, are often reciprocally adjusted,
the leaflet-blades becoming ampler with decrease
in number. In southern Goias and the Triangulo
Mineiro the distinction that 1 have drawn be-
tween var. capillipes and subsp. gracilis var. grac-
tis is sometimes arbitrary.
A specimen from Mato Grosse (mun. Rosario
do Oeste, de Carvatho & Lewis 2196, NY), unlike
ali other material of var. capillipes, is perfectly
glabrous throughout and would key, in conse-
quence, to subsp. filipes. In relatively coarse stems
and plump capitula it seems, nevertheless, closer
to var. capillipes, of which I suppose it to be a
minor variant.
In selecting a lectotype for Af. capillipes from
among specimens cited in the protologue I have
preferred Regnell I71/509* from Caldas over the
rest because its exceptionally long peduncles seem
to have suggested the epithet. The typus of var.
brevifolia is an over-mature plant that had shed
its primary cauline leaves. Its diminished rameal
appear superficially different from those of com-
mon var. capillipes, but residual leaf-stks show
that early cauline leaves had up to eight pairs of
pinnae, like those of modern collections from the
same region.

Following Bentham’s classification one would
be obliged to refer this mimosa to ser. Asperatae,
but it differs externally from unarmed M. gracilis
var. capillipes solely in the acquisition of aculei,
sometimes inconspicuous and few in number.
Theoretically it might be supposed to have arisen
as a hybrid between diplotricha and M. grac-
ilis var. capillipes, which are marginally sym-
patric on the Chapada. This hypothesis would
not account satisfactorily for the abundance of
var. invisiformis at elevations above those at-
tained by either supposed parent, nor for its ab-
sence elsewhere in their wide common range of
dispersal. In practice M. diplotricha is distin-
guished from var. invisiformis by denser arma-
ment, shorter peduncles, and fertility of almost
every flower in the capitulum, the pods conse-
quently forming a dense cluster close against the
stem.

Stems either pliantly humifuse and then po-
tentially much elongating, or relatively short and
stiff, then either prostrate or assurgent or densely
tufted, never aculeolate; pubescence of subsp.
capillipes, leaf-formula ii-x(-xivV2-9(-10), the
rachis of longer pinnae 2-8 mm; flower and pod
of var. capillipes, the pod either glabrous or
densely villosulous, but never aculeolate.
This subspecies differs from both the foregoing
and the following by abbreviated pinnae and
consequently by leaves of proportionately long
narrow outline, The var. gracilis differs some-
times from var. capillipes by length of pinnae
alone, but often also by more numerous as well
as shorter pinnae. In var. brevissima leaf-reduc-
tion is carried a step further, the longer pinnae
being yet shorter than those of var, gracilis and
commonly also fewer by at least one or two pairs.
Length of pinna-rachis, number of pinnae, num-
ber of leaflets, each varies through a continuum
between the average robust var. capillipes and
the highly reduced var, brevissima, but the curves
of variation are poorly correlated with each oth-
er, Ambiguous specimens link the three varieties,
but are fewest when the arbitrarily chosen mea-
surement of longer pinnae is accepted as the de-
ciding factor. While var. brevissima intergrades
with var, gracilis on the one hand, it is also very
closely akin to, perhaps the precursor of, the yet
more reduced or ultimately ephedroid, essen-
tially efoliate 4. paucifolia, M. piptostegia and
M. phyllodinea.

As defined by key characters var. gracilis is a
polymorphic, perhaps genetically heterogeneous
variety, poised between subsp. capiltipes var.
capillipes and subsp. gracilis var. brevissima and
intergradient with both. The type-number, Poh!
consists of two elements, mounted
on one sheet at Kew but separate at Vienna. The
lectotype proposed herein, probable model for
plate 92 in Flora brasiliensis, has leaf-formula
y-vii/5—6 and pilosulous leaflets; the second el-
ement, in bud only, here referred to var. brevissi-
ma but in reality only transitional to it, has leaf-
formula iii-vii/3—-5 and glabrate leaflets. Togeth-
er they illustrate the difficulty of separating neatly
or defining exactly any infraspecific component
of M. gracifis sens. lat. A collection from near
Formosa, Goias (irwin 15447, NY) is ambigu-
ously intermediate in another way between vars.
gracilis, of which it has the leaf-formula, and
brevissima, of which it has the relatively stiff
stems, and is further remarkable for pods gla-
brous in some plants and densely pitosulous
overall in others, In length of petiole var. gracilis
is as variable as var. capillipes,

Range of the species.
The varieties of subsp. filiformis are almost
everywhere sympatric with some variety of subsp.
capillipes or subsp. gracilis, and collectively dif-
fer from these only in glabrous foliage and flow-
ers. The subspecies might be supposed to consist
simply of glabrate mutants of the sympatric pi-
losulous variety, but this is not the case, for where
they coincide in range components of any two
subspecies differ not only in pubescence but also
in habit, or in armature, or in leaf-formula, often
to marked degree. Indeed the subspecies behave,
in any particular locality or particular segment
of their ranges, as though specifically distinct. It
is only when data are assembled from long suites
of specimens that the collective ranges of mor-
phological variation, in everything except ves-
ture, are revealed as fully confluent.
The closely related but still poorly known MM.
burchellii appears to differ from subsp. fliformis
principally in the broad pod (+6, not 3-5 mm
wide) composed of longer articles (+6, not 3-5
mm long). Fruits of this group are, however, too
little known to furnish proven taxonomic char-
acters,

The var. leiocarpa was first described and fig-
ured by Burkart in his revision of Argentine Afi-
mosa but was subordinated to the not very close-
ly related 44. sefioi, a species at that time known
to Burkart only through photographs. His mis-
take was acknowledged in Flora Hustrada Cata-
rinense, but he made no disposition of var. feio-
carpa other than to suggest that it deserved specific
status. I have failed to disentangle it from the
complex of AM. gracilis, of which it has the flower
and pod, or to distinguish it at any level above
that of variety from M. gracilis subsp. filiformis,
which is similarly glabrous and commonly re-
motely aculeolate. The var. /eiocarpa seems barely
to differ from var. filiformis in slightly fewer pairs
of leaflets, but it ranges far southward, mostly
below the tropic line. It is notable that Burkart,
while adhering to Bentham’s serial criteria and
accordingly referring var. /eiocarpa to ser. As-
peratae, noted its striking likeness to M. (ser.
Leptopodae) capillipes, that is to M. gracilis subsp.
capiillipes of this account.
I here interpret the fragmentary type of M.
graminiformis as an etiolated stem of var. /eio-
carpa, perhaps drawn out in competition with
taller campo grasses. It has leaf-stalks to 12 cm,
petioles to 8.5 cm, interpinnal segments of leaf-
stalk to 2 cm, and pinna-rachis to 12 mm long.

Mimosa burchellii is closely related to M. grac-
itis sensu lato and, being essentially glabrous, is
only with difficulty dissociated from M. gracilis
subsp. filiformis unless the relatively broad pod,
composed of exceptionally long articles, is pres-
ent, The thick texture and chocolate-brown dis-
coloration of the leaves, alike in modern collec-
tions and Burchell’s original gathering, seem also
characteristic of the species. The date of Bur-
chell’s collection, in early anthesis, is not re-
corded. Irwin collected it also in young flower
and once in fruit in the month of April, later than
would be expected of Af. gracilisin upland Goias,

In habit M. pratincofa resembles humifuse
forms of M. gracilis sensu lato but differs from
all of them in essentially sessile leaves, the first
pair of pinnae arising directly beyond the leaf-
pulvinus. The form of A. gracilis most common
in east-central Goids is var. invisiformis, found
not in brejo but in campo rupestre and dry cerra-
do habitats, and this differs further from 4M. pra-
tincoia in at least thinly aculeolate stems and in
pilosulous stems and flowers. The type-popula-
tion of M4. pratincola was taken from saturated
sandy-clay soi! of brejo, where it formed exten-
sive carpets of interlacing humifuse stems.

This elegant dwarf mimosa was first collected
in 1895 “entre Bananal et le Rio in the
present Federal District by Glaziou (no. 2/059,
P!), growing with or close io the related M. grac-
ilis var. brevissima (ne. 21058, G, K!). Glaziou
not only confused these two species, but misiden-
tified both (1906: 182) as Af. paucifolia. This
allopatric relative differs from 474. gatesiae in jun-
ceous growth-form, in much longer leaf-stalks
not 1-2 em), and in leaf-formula (i-iii/
2-3, not ii-iv/6—-8). From undeniably similar and
partly sympatric 44. gracilis var. brevissima the
new species differs in more numerous leaflets (to
6-8, not 2—5 pairs), in characteristically recurved
pinnae, and in the deltate interpinnal scale in
place of a subulate spicule.
it is my pleasure to dedicate this species, with
respect and affection, to Dr. Bronwen Gates, au-
thor ofan esteemed monograph of Banisteriopsis
(Fl. Neotrop. Monogr. 30. 1982), who partici-
pated in its discovery on Chapada dos Veadeiros.

In habit M. multiceps stands between the erect,
ephemerally leafy 4. piptoptera and the more
conventional, diffuse and permanently foliate
species such as M. gracilis sens. lat., or 4, bur-

by leaf-formula, subterete leaf-stalks, relatively
ample leaflets, and plump capitula, The flower-
ing season, June to August, is further remarkable.

flowers suggests rapid growth from a xylopodium
such as occurs in Chamaecrista claussenii Benth.)

Hassler (1.c.) eloquently described his surprise
at discovering this peculiar little mimosa flow-
ering in early spring on campo bumed the pre-
ceding fall. The perfect but greatly simplified
lower leaves with axillary peduncles all crowded
along the lower half or two thirds of the stem
and concealed by a terminal plume of extremely
fine grasslike phyllodia are unmatched in the ge-
nus. Hasster found the young phyllodia orange-
red turning green in age, and likened them in
mass to some species of horsetail (Equisetunt).
The only plausible relationship of M. equisetum
seems to lie in the direction of M. paucifolia, M.
piptoptera and M. phyllodinea, all endemic to
planaltine Brazil, but it may nevertheless have
arisen independently of these from a more gen-
eralized ancestor, perhapsakin to M. gracilis sen-
su lato.

Because the flower is not yet known, the sys-
tematic position and relationships of this re-
markable mimosa remain to be demonstrated,
but it will likely prove to belong to ser. Pauci-
foliatae, a group highly diversified in campo hab-
itats of the Brazilian Planalto, where it has un-
dergone strange and unexpected modifications of
foliage. Within ser. Paucifoliatae, as indeed in
the genus as a whole, M4. flabellifolia may be
known by the seemingly sessile leaves consisting
of one pair of pinnae each of which bears one or
two full pairs and one odd posterior leaflet, all
crowded on a secondary axis not over 1 mm in
length. Apart from the leaf-formula, the habit,
the angulate stems rising erect from a xylopo-
dium, and the terminal pseudo-raceme of cras-
pedia suggest kinship with M. piptoptera.

Mimosa corynadenia resembles in many
spects M4. adenocarpa and M. orthocarpa, but
differs from both in the broad pod (8.5-11, not
mm wide). From south Brazilian AZ. ina-
moena, of which the pod is not known, it differs
in fewer (3-5, not 6-10) pairs of pinnae in larger
leaves, in stout and longer peduncles (20-55, not
6-11 mm), and in capitula twice as large. The
range of M. corynadenia as presently known is
inexplicable in phytogeographic terms.

Speculation about the real affinity of M4. ina-
moena is hampered by lack of the pod. The spe-
cies was associated by Bentham with Af, bimnu-
cronata and the Antillean Fagaracanthae that,
perhaps only by coincidence, have pairs of aculei
inserted behind most pairs of pinnae; but the
plant does not closely resemble any of these in
gross habit or indumentum. In leaf-formula, in
venation of leaflets and in proportions of the
flower it seems more similar to the also glandular
M. adenocarpa, although certainly specifically
distinct in the glabrous leaflets and corollas, in
the smaller capitula (3-3.5, not 4-7.5 mm diam.)
and filaments exserted only about 2.5 (nat 5—6)
mm from the corolla. Paraguayan M. tobatiensis,
with nearly the same leaf-formula, has unarmed
leaf-stalks, much longer peduncles, and flowers a
third larger arranged in ellipsoid capitula.

Between March 11 and 13, 1973 Dr. W. An-
derson and companions collected within a few
kilometers of Monte de Alegre de Goias five mi-
mosas referable to one or other of Bentham’s
series Asperatae and Somniantes NY): no.
6833, typical prickly Af. (Asperatae) adenocarpa,
with tiny, indistinctly costate leaflets, 1-nerved
corolla-lobes and short-stipitate pods; no. 68/2,
typical unarmed M. (Somniantes) somnians var.
with equally small but dorsally ven-
ulose, subglaucescent leaflets, pluristriate corol-
la-lobes and long-stipitate pods; no. 6892, type
of M. somnambulans, resembling the last except
for much larger leaflets (fruit unknown); and nos.
6839, 6907, here named M. hypnodes, in which
the venulose leaflets of Af. somnambulans co-
incide with aculeate stems, delicately 4-nerved
corollas and the short-stipitate pods of M. ad-
enocarpa. The two collections of M. hypnodes
have the same foliage but differ in details of in-
florescence, no. 6839 having the short bracts,
glabrous corollas and pods exactly of M. adeno-
and no. 6907 longer bracts and pilosulous
flowers foreign to all the rest but suggestive of
widespread Af. paludosa, probably present in the
same region. The odd assortment of flowers,
bracts and pods encountered in these collections
are ofa sort that might have arisen from hybrids
between M. somnians and M. paludosa, but there
is this difficulty: the large, dorsally venulose leaf-
lets common to M. somnambulans and M. hyp-
nodes, which differ from one another so greatly
in venulation of the petals, occur in none of the
three widespread species which could be sup-
posed to furnish the other variable features. I am
consequently obliged, though with reluctance, to
describe Mf. somnambulans and M. hypnodes in
the rank of species. If a distinction between stri-
ate-nervulose and membranous corolla cannot
be upheld as significant, the taxonomy of the
Asperatae will founder.
Beside Anderson’s two collections ] have seen
only one other of M4. hypnedes, a flowerless plant
collected on a tributary of rio Manoel Alves (rio
Reason) by Pohl in July 1819, on his journey
northward from Sao Felix to Porto Real (K, NY,
W). This collection was tentatively referred by
Bentham to a variety of M. elliptica.

The two known collections of this ambiguous
mimosa were found misidentified, one as M.
uliginosa, the other as M. paraguariae affin., but
their leaves differ from those of all members of
ser. Stipellares in narrow subulate paraphyllidia
and conspicuous spicules between each pair of
pinnae. The venulation of the leaflets is like that
of M4. paraguariae but fainter, whereas the ellip-
soid capitula recall Mf. uliginosa, Despite these
evocative resemblances I believe the true affinity
of M, tobatiensis is with remotely allopatric M.
orthocarpa, from which it differs in leaflet-ve-
nation and in the viscid-hispidulous indumen-
tum of the stems: in 4. tobatiensis consisting of
short stout setulae of nearty equal length, in AZ.
orthocarpa of extremely slender-shafted setae of
different lengths intermingled. Similar also in
prowth-habit and leaf-spicules is 4. aureliana of
the Brazil-Paraguay border country, but this is
unarmed, has only 2-4 (not 6-9) pairs of pinnae
in larger leaves, and globose (not ellipsoid ca-
pitula). Leaf-stalks characteristically armed at in-
sertion of pinnae by a pair of aculei, leaflet-ve-
nation, and tiny globose capitula borne on
peduncles about 1 (not 1.5-3.5) cm long effec-
tively separate the also distantly allopatric pla-
naltine M. inamoena,

Mimosa paraguariae was assigned by Micheli
to ser. Leptopodae, later transferred by Hassler
(1910b: 7) to ser. Asperatae where thought to be
related to M. adenocarpa, and at last recognized
by Burkart (1948: 61) as a member of ser, Sti-
pellares, of which it has the enlarged paraphyl-
lidia that resemble diminutive true leaflets. Its
nearest relative in this series is M, iperoénsis,
which see for discussion of differences. It appears
far removed from 44. adenocarpa by relatively
broad herbaceous stipules, absence of aculei, and
lack of interpinnal spicules. The stipules vary
somewhat in absolute and proportionate width,
but I feel confident that the Paraguayan plants
segregated by Hassler as a subspecies of Bahian
M. cordistipula are nothing other than broad-
stipulate individuals of 4, paraguariae sens. lat.,
of which they have all other characters, including
the characteristic pod. True M. cordistipuia has
much in common with M. paraguariae in the
way of stipules and indumentum, but differs in
spinulose-tipped leaf-stalks and leaflets, in trim-
erous flowers, in fruticulose habit of growth, and
in conspicuously different ecology. The also Ba-
hian M. ulbrichiana, closely akin to M. cordistip-
ula and likewise trimerous, superficially resem-
bles Af. paraguariae in foliage and indumentum,
but has essentially veinless leaflets, and pods
merely glandular-puberulent, not viscidly hispid.
While Mf. paraguariae appears stable in char-
acters of flower and pod it varies in leaf-formula
and particularly in quality of pubescence. Singly
or together these provide characters that support
several varietal categories already described by
Hassler, but here maintained in slightly modified
form.

The foregoing description is compiled from the

thor to be most closely related to M. trachycarpa,
but the protologue suggests even nearer affinity
to small-leaved forms of M. paraguariae. These
differ, however, in lack of cauline aculei. The
discovery of M. cordobensis established a notable
westward range-extension for ser. Stipellares in
Argentina.

above an obscure stemonozone, pink, exserted
4-5 mm; ovary densely glandular. Pods (poorly
known) described under varieties, variable in
outline but always (so far as densely glan-
dular-setulose overall.
The type of AZ. iperoénsis, most flowers of which
were described as tetrandrous, was misinter-
preted by Hoehne as a taxonomically isolated
Eu-mimosa, but its true affinity to the diploste-
monioons ser. Stipellares, in particular to M. para-
guariae, was perceived by Burkart (1948: 23, 65),
who found the stamens variable in number, not
constantly four but commonly between five and
seven. As long ago as 1820 the species had been
collected in the same region by St. Hilaire, whose
specimens are partly (C?//436bis, unarmed
with normally octandrous flowers, and partly (C’/
1410, P) randomly setaculeate and 5-8-androus.
No taxonomic distinction can be made between
plants with perfect and partly imperfect androe-
cia, and I do not here propose to recognize for-
mally the aculeate state, pending verification in
the field of its intrapopulational stability.
T associate with the variable nucleus of pop-
ulations in southeastern S. Paulo the Paraguayan
plants that Hassler mistook for unarmed forms
of M. adenocarpa, a species significantly different
in narrow stipules and paraphyllidia, in spiculate
leaf-stalks, and in faintly 1-nerved leaflets. Some
Paraguayan populations, however, differ from
typical .M. iperoénsis in longer, more distant pin-
nae coinciding with slightly more numerous leaf-
lets and glabrate corollas; these were first de-
scribed by Hassler and reappear here in a new
context. Marked differences in width of pod are
described under the varieties, but too few ex-
amples are at hand to establish their significance.
Mimosa iperoénsis has almost everything in
common with MM. paraguariae, with which it is
marginally sympatric on the Paraguayan Plateau,
but it has smaller capitula, less exserted fila-
ments, and smaller, thick-textured leaflets more
coarsely venulose on the dorsal face.

An obscure species still known with certainty
only from Sello’s one collection and what is
thought to be its progeny grown by F. Otto at
Berlin; to be sought in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil,
or in Uruguay.
In the context of its group Mf. kermesina is
distinguished by lack of prickies, a leaf-formula
of ii-v/8-12, and opposite, notably lustrous leaf-
lets coarsely 3-nerved dorsally. When rediscov-
ered, its kinship to M. iperoénsis and M. cruenta
will require reassessment.
Granted the equation Af. kKermesina (1835) =
M. lucidula (1842), proposed by Bentham in
1876, there is no argument about the correct name
for this species. Bentham may have known M.
kermesina only from the condensed description
given by Walpers (Repert. 1: 883. 1842) and may
not have seen Otto & Dietrich’s detailed pro-
tologue, which faithfully matches the flowering
specimens that survive.

Microphyllous subshrubs from heavy woody
rootstock, the diffuse or assurgent, randomly
branched stems + 5—15 dm, almost always armed

placed infrapetiolar aculeus and often 1-2 in-
frastipular ones, the aculei straight horizontal or

capitula mostly solitary but occasionally gemi-
nate in a series of !f-axils along new branchlets,
the peduncles about as long as or longer than the
associated If. Stipules erect lanceolate or narrow-

Mimosa cruenta ts the species treated latterly
by Burkart as Af. amphigena, and may be sep-
arated from closely related M. sanguinolenta by
unarmed stems and by pods that break, albeit
sometimes tardily, into free-falling articles. The
pubescence of foliage and pod varies in density
and proportions of villi and gland-tipped setulae,
several states being distinguished taxonomically
by Burkart. I have not the material to settle one
way or another the status of these forms, which
require detailed observation in the field, Typical
M. cruenta corresponds to M. amphigena var.
eglandulosa, and M. trachycarpa to the state with
pronounced setular pubescence on the pod. The
fruit of M. cruenta, first collected by Gibert, was
mistakenly attributed by Bentham (1876: 366)
to Af. implexa.

While accepting without reservation Burkart's
analysis of the original M. cruenta Bentham into
two species, one (4. amphigena Burkart) with
armed stems and craspedia, the other (M7. cruenta
sensu Burkart) with unarmed stems and val-
vately dehiscent pods, I cannot endorse his typ-
ification of M. cruenta by Sello 3085 at C, illus-
trated by Field Museum Negative 2/876. It is
not disputed that Bentham derived the proto-
logue of Mf. cruenta from elements of two taxa.
In Flora brasiliensis (1876, 1.c.) Bentham ad-
mitted as much: “Specimina typica Tweedieana
omnia aculeata sunt, Selloana aculeata et iner-
mia. Specimina pauca inermia pinnis 4—5-jugis
varietatem vel forte speciem distinctam indi-
cant.’ This forthright statement unequivocally
lectotypifies Af. cruenta by the aculeate plants
collected in Uruguay valley by Tweedie, whose
field-note on color of the flowers suggested the
epithet. These plants represent in my opinion
nothing other than Af. amphigena Burkart, which
consequently must fall into synonymy. Sello’s
unarmed plant that was mentioned by Bentham
as found among specimens of Af. cruenta has
apparently never received a valid name, though
it has been described in meticulous detail and
well illustrated by Burkart (1948, 1979, 1987,
ll.cc.) under the name M. cruenta. The specimen
chosen as typus of M. sanguinolenta is among
those identified by Burkart as M. cruenta.
I have seen no material corresponding with
the plant described by Burkart as:

According to the protologue this appears to be
a completely glabrate state of Af. sanguinolenia,
unarmed and with valvately dehiscent pods of
the species.

While the foregoing description of Af. ura-
guensis is derived directly from specimens, the
concept of the species owes everything to Bur-
kart’s exemplary revision (1948, l.c.). Glabrous
leaflets, aliernate along the pinna rachis in most
or many leaves, an essentially valvate dehiscence
of the pod, and particularly an adaptation to in-
termittently flooded banks of the Uruguay River
are the principal diagnostic features in the con-
text of ser. Stipellares. I differ from Burkart only
in reverting to the original spelling of the epithet,
evidently intentional because Hooker referred to
the country itself as Uraguay. The variant spell-
ing reappears also in inga uraguensis Hook.

In unknown habitat but to be expected in open
stony campo, apparently collected only by Sello,
about 1815-1817, either in s. Rio Grande do Sul,
Brazil or in adjacent Uruguay.
Mimosa bracteolaris is distinguished among
unarmed Stipellares by low stature, gray-villo-
sulous indumentum without trace of setulae or
glands, a simple leaf-formula (+ii/3—5, so far as
known), and capitula hispid before anthesis with
emergent linear bracts. The mature fruit, whether
a craspedium or valvately dehiscent, may indi-
cate closer kindred in the series than can be
guessed at present.
An aged specimen, cryptically labelled 7460
but without indication of collector, in the Na-
tional Herbarium at Rio de Janeiro, very closely
resembles authentic Af. bracteolaris, and may in
fact be part of Sello’s collection.

The almost exclusively extratropical M. bifur-
ca is readily recognized by the syndrome of glu-
tinous foliage devoid of setae, orbicular-reniform
paraphyllidia, and sessile leaflets arranged alter-
nately along the pinna-rachis, It varies much in
stature, in display of capituta either in emersed
pseudoracemeés or in mostly axillary patterns, in
leaf-formula, and in size of leaflets. The often
alternate insertion of pinnae along the leaf-stalk
sometimes suggests an imparipinnate leaf.
The common forms of M. bifurca, widespread
from eastern Paraguay through northeastern Ar-
gentina to interior Uruguay and (cf. Burkart, 1979:
134 + map) Atlantic Santa Catarina, have uni-
formly tiny leaflets (variable nevertheless in
number) and conventionally plane, triangular or
deltate stipules appressed to the stem. Locally in
Paraguay the species is represented by a rela-
tively coarse var. hassferiana, distinguished by
large, mutually distant leaflets. Perhaps no more
than a form of this is var. reducta, with only one
or two pairs of pinnae to the leaf. Finally var.
desmanthoides, localized so far as known in
southeastern S, Paulo and disjunct within the
range of var. bifurca in Misiones, Argentina, dif-
fers substantially from var. difurca only in bi-
zarrely modified stipules. It remains to be as-
certained whether these stipuies are a casual lusus
or genetically determined.

Mimosa glycyrrhizoides might rationally be in-
terpreted as an armed variant of M. dbifurca, with
which it agrees in leaf-formula and especially in
gland-dotted leaflets arising alternately along the
pinna-rachis. It differs, however, not merely in
aculeate stems and leaf-stalks but also in the
densely hispid and glandular-hispid, elongately
burrlike pods, strikingly different from the
smooth, merely resin-spotted pod characteristic
of all known forms of M. bifirca. The coinci-
dence of glandular-verruculose foliage with a his-
pid pod recalling that of Giycyrrhiza lepidota Nutt.

In Flora brasiliensis Bentham confounded, un-
der the name 44. obevata, two species superfi-
cially similar in leaf-formula: a corky-barked lat-
iciferous tree of the cerrado to which the name
M. obovata was originally applied, and a prickly
liana of wet coastal forest described herein under
the name MV. ceratonia var. pseudo-obovata. Riz-
zini & Mattos Filho capably and in great detail
differentiated between the two, but having mis-
takenly applied the epithet obovata to the coastal
liana were obliged to redescribe the genuine M.
obovata as M. laticifera. The situation was clar-
ified in a recent paper (Barneby, 1985a, l.c.). 1
have since learned that M. obovata Bentham is
a posterior homonym which must give way after
all to M. faticifera Rizzini and Mattos Filho.
A record of M, laticifera from Ceara (Sa. da
Baturité, Bro. José Eugénie 582, RB, not mapped)

0.5-2.5 mm, either glabrous throughout or the
livid hornotinous stems together with most If-
and inflorescence-axes thinly pilosulous with
spreading whitish or sordid hairs to 0.15-0.4 mm
often mixed with minute livid granules, the plane
or marginally subrevolute Ifts bicolored, dull oli-
vaceous above, beneath paler and at times re-
sidually ciliolate or even thinly pilosulous, the
inflorescence usually a succession of pseudora-
cemes or a pyramidal panicle of small globose
capitula, these exserted 1-4 dm beyond foliage,
the peduncles rarely all axillary. Stipules linear-
lanceolate or subulate (1.5-)2-5.5 x 0.6-1 mm,
tardity deciduous. Leaf- stalks (4-)6-12(-14) cm,
the petiole 2-4.5(-6) cm, at middle (0.6-)0.8-1.4
mm diam., the shallow open ventral groove sim-
ply bridged between pinna-pairs or the bridge
seldom with a small spicule, the interpinnal seg-
ments mostly (1.2-)1,5-3(-3.3) cm; pinnae cam-
monty 3-4(-5)-jug, of some small distal lvs 2-jug.
(no further described), in var. interior all 2(-3)-
jug, the rachis 1,5-4 cm, the segments between
pairs of lfts and between first pair and the minute
subulate paraphyllidia 7-15 mm; Ifts of all pin-
nae commonly 3-, or of some 4-5-jug., less often
ofall or of the proximal pair alone 2-jug., in any
case a little distally accrescent, the blades
obliquely obovate obtuse or emarginate (10—)12-
16(-30) x (7-)9-19(-22) mm, at base rounded
or shallowly cordate on proximal side and cu-
neate on distal one, (3-)4-6-nerved from pul-
vinule, the straight midrib excentric, the primary
nerves all expiring or weakly brochidodrome well
within margin, the strong inner posterior nerve
ascending nearly to blade apex, all prominulous
beneath only and giving rise to faint open retic-
ular venulation, Peduncles 2-5 per node, 7-16
(25) mm, either aculeate or unarmed; capitula
without filaments (4-)4.5-6 mm diam., prior to
anthesis moriform; bracts 0.6-0.9 x 0.3-0.6 mm;
lowers ail or almost all 3-merous 6-androus, the
buds obovoid, glabrous or minutely papillate at
tip; calyx campanulate 0.55-0.9 mm, the low-
deltate teeth 0.1-0.15 mm, glabrous or minutely
ciliolate, corolla cream-white or pink-tipped,
vase-shaped 1.9-2.7 mm, the ovate 1-nerved
lobes 0.8-1.2 mm, toward apex callous and shal-
lowly hooded; filaments white or cream-colored,
free, the longer set exserted 5.5-7.3 mm; ovary
either glabrous or marginally pilosulous and
glandular on faces. Pods mostly 1-3 per capitu-
lum, sessile, in profile oblong, commonly a little
decurved (35-)40-60 x (10-)12-19(-20) mm, at
apex broadly obtusely apiculate, the shallowly
undulate replum 0.65-1 mm wide, armed with
1-3 files of stout, backwardly curved aculei to
1.5-2.5 mm, the papery green or com-
monly brown- or red-tinged, ultimately dark
brown or blackish valves low-colliculate over each
of 6-8(-9) seeds, when ripe separating entire from
replum, inertly dehiscent; seeds in broad profile
+5-8 x 3-5 mm, the testa lustrous black.
A syndrome of armed stems, trimerous flower
with white filaments, and a broad planocom-
pressed pod consisting of backwardly aculeate
replum and firmly papery valves that fall away
in one piece characterizes M. ceratonia and close-
ly related M. medioxima and M. carvathoi. South
of Amazonia these are with one exception con-
fined to the Atlantic coastal plain or lower foot-
hills, but Af. ceratonia occurs also in the West
Indies, Because the center of diversity for the
group is clearly in Bahia, and because M. cera-
tonia is isolated morphologically among the mi-
mosas of the Antilles, its occurrence there is
probably secondary, though certainly ancient,
since it was seen there by Charles Plumier in late
XVII century.
Detailed comparison of Antillean M, ceratonia
with its Brazilian counterpart, which Bentham
in Flora brasiliensis mistook for Mf. obevata and
which Taubert later described as M. pseudo-
obovata, discloses no difference of substance.
Taubert distinguished his species from 44. cer-
atonia by pubescence, larger leaflets, and un-
armed peduncles, but pubescence alone survives
as distinctive, and this, although always wanting
in the West Indies, varies considerably between
Brazilian populations otherwise alike. Since there
is no perceptible difference in leaf-formula, in
venation of leaflets, or in structure of flower and
fruit between Brazilian and Antillean plants of
this group, it has become impossible to recognize
more than one variable and widespread species.
For an account of the long-lasting confusion be-
tween Brazilian M. ceratonia and M. obovata see
discussion of M4. /aticifera (p. 257).
In the first description of this mimosa, Plumier
likened the leaves to those of Sifigua Tournefort,
the Locust Bean that Linnaeus called Ceratonia,
from which the epithet is derived.

In the protologue of var. interior I stressed as
apparent differences from var. pseudo-obevata
the leaf-formula, the apparently dissimilar ecol-
ogy, and the axillary rather than pseudoracemose
or paniculate capitula. On reflection I think it
likely that the inflorescence character may be
fortuitous, and the others need testing against
further collections.

Mimosa medioxima has the sarmentose habit,
thin pubescence, prickly stems, obovate leaflets
and woodland habitat of M. ceratonia var. pseu-
do-obovata, but almost the simplified leaf-for-
mula of M. carvathoi. The type has a short, few-
capitulate, leafy-bracteate inflorescence that con-
trasts with the usually ample leafless panicle of
M. ceratonia; but it may be an uncharacteristic
specimen in this respect. While M4. medioxima
resembles M. carvathoi in number of leaflets per
pinna, the pinnae are fewer and borne on shorter
common leaf-stalks, and the leaflets themse]ves
are of different shape. ceratonia var. in-
terior approaches M. medioxima in simplified
leaf-formula, but has the long leaf-stalks of its
species.

the mostly trimerous, ochroleucous flower and

Its arborescent rather than scrambling habit of
growth, only residually aculeate leaf-stalks, and
larger, fewer, firmer leaflets are adaptations to a
dune habitat.

Of the two collections here referred to Af.
brachystachya the type is armed below the pa-
niculate inflorescence with stout scattered prick-
les, whereas that from near Aracuai (Mendes Ma-
gathdes 15407, NY, UB) is unarmed. Otherwise
they are in close agreement and I cannot think
them other than conspecific.
Mimosa brachystachya appears related on the
one hand to M, caesalpiniifolia and on the other
to M. ceratonia, both similar in leaf-formula and
in trimerous flowers, but the flowers of M.
brachystachya are described both by Glaziou and
by Mendes Magalhaes as pink, whereas the fil-
aments of kindred species are consistently white
or cream-white, so that the Aowers or partial
inflorescences are perceived as white, even though
the lobes of the florets may be tinged with red.
Aside from flower-color, M. brachystachya dif-
fers from M. caesalpiniifolia in weak sarmentose,
not independently arborescent life-form, but in
this respect is not different from M. ceratonia
var, pseudo-obovata. The ellipsoid capitula, of-
ten with a few flowers scattered along the pe-
duncle below the principal head, are interme-
diate in form between the globose capitula of M4.
ceratonia and the short narrow catkins of M.
caesalpiniifolia. The venation of the leaflets is
also intermediate in some respects. The second-
ary nerves arising from the midrib are brochid-
odrome, as in M4. ceratonia, but loop back on
one another only just short of a fine marginal
nerve that is lacking in M4. ceratonia; they do not,
as in M, caesalpiniifolia, run straight out to anas-
tomosis with the marginal] one. It remains to be
learned whether the pod of M. brachystachya
breaks when ripe into free-falling articles, like
that of M. caesalpiniifolia, or whether the valves
fall away from the repium in one piece, as in 4.
ceratonia, a feature that will be crucial in as-
sessment of the present species’ true affinity.
In the introduction to his Liste, Glaziou (1906)
spoke of a Rio Preto in Minas Gerais that nins
northward to Rio Grande from Mt. Itatiaia, and
I have suggested above that this is the type-lo-
cality of Af. brachystachya. There are, however,
several streams of this name in Minas Gerais,
and moreover several hamlets called Sie Gon-
galo, and it is possible that Glaziou’s locality was
on the upper rio Jequitinhonha, where Ad.
brachystachya was rediscovered by Mendes Ma-
galhaes.
A Mimosa brachystachys attributed to Vahl
(Ecl. amer, 3: 34, 1807) by DeCandolle (Prod.
syst. veg. 2: 437, in syn. 1825) is a mistake for
M. macrostachya and therefore no impediment
to M. brachystachya Taubert.

Jn the protologue of Mf. guarantitica Hassler
recognized its evident affinity to 44. misera, from
which, as from M. minarum and other members
of its group, it differs principally in leaf-formula,
in disposition of pinnae along the leaf-stalk, and
in number or texture of leaflets, as set forth in
the key to the series. Its discontinuous dispersal
is enigmatic. Until lately it was known only from
Paraguay and adjoining Argentina and was nat-
urally supposed to be native there. All its close
relatives, however, are endemic to northeastern
Brazil, and it therefore seems probable that Af.
guaranitica is a relatively late immigrant to the
Parana basin, though whether by natural means
of dispersal or by human intervention it is im-
possible to determine. The unexpected appear-
ance of Mf. guaranitica in Tamaulipas has two
possible explanations: it is an anthropochorous
newcomer to Mexico, or shares the apparently
natural bicentric range of, e.g., Raynchosia senna
Hook.

The material that I refer to M. misera includes
both youthfully vigorous young plants in ample
leaf and older drought-stressed, sparsely flow-
ered or fruiting ones; these appear very different
in superficial aspect and are actually dissimilar
in leaf-formula and in both density and com-
position of the indumentum. Some moreover are
randomly aculeate, others unarmed except for
random smal) prickles on some leaf-stalks. My
concept of the species is consequently somewhat
amorphous and indeterminate, and it requires
testing by close observation in the field. The spe-
cies seems to differ from M4. brevipinna in fewer
pinnae and prevailingly shorter petioles, and from
M. guaranitica in sturdier growth-habit and
broader leaflets. It is closely related to both.
No two collections of M. misera are precisely
alike, and in each collection that consists of sev-
eral plants I have found some measure of vari-
ation in development of larger primary or shorter
fasciculate leaves, and in proportion and density
of the several! sorts of trichome: minute incurved
hairs, longer spreading plain ones, gland-tipped
setulae, and setaculei. The intrapopulational
variation in stature and potential size of primary
leaves, which may reflect conditions ef growth
rather than genetic differentiation, is also so
marked as to have induced description of seg-
regates. Of these M. remansoana represents one
small extreme. It was doubtfully referred by
Harms (o ser. Stipellares, thereby escaping com-
parison with its broad-stipulate kandred with
trimerous flowers close at hand in the tower S.
Francisco valley. The tall extreme is 4. francis-
cana, which Bentham himself doubted might be
vigorous MM. misera, described from stunted
specimens. Mimosa franciscana was based on
two collections from “islands and banks of rio
S. Francisco near both annotated by
Bentham as Af. misera var.: in one (M, ticketed
no. 557 = F Neg. 6/82, no. the unarmed
stems appear to have been diffuse and the pod
is densely villosulous but lacks setae; in the other
(M, ticketed n. 553 = IPA Neg. 1347, n. 554)
the stems appear to be more erect, possibly fru-
ticose, and are sparsely aculeate, while the pods
are glabrous except for short setulae on the valves.
Neither agrees at all points with the protologue
of M. franciscana, which may have been com-
piled from both. I have arbitrarily selected the
first of these (M! annotated) as and in-
terpret it as a robust form of Af. misera. I am
unable at present to classify the second collection
but suspect it is little more than a form of the
same. Until this can be confirmed, I exclude its
aberrant characteristics from my definition of
var, misera,
Very close to M. misera and not, in my opin-
ion, specifically distinguishable, is M4. adenocar-
pa var. subinermis Benth., which seems to differ
inconclusively in somewhat more numerous pin-
nae coinciding with prickly stems. It agrees per-
fectly with M. misera in broad mucronate stip-
ules and trimerous flowers, and tacks the
interpinnal spicules and paraphyllidia character-
istic of Mf. adenocarpa. It is connected to var.
misera directly through Hatschbach 39588 (NY)
from near Morro do Chapeu, which has the leaf-
formula of var, subinermis but unarmed stems.
Provisionally but without much confidence I
maintain this as a variety.

The type-collection of Af. leptantha shows the
partly glandular indumentum, the espiculate leaf-
stalks, and the trimerous corolla characteristic of
M. misera and its allies, among which Bentham
placed it. In this alliance the reduced leaf-for-
mula (ii-v/3-6) and relatively long pedicels are,
so far as appears from one collection, diagnostic.
The species appears close to M4. guaranitica, and
may possibly be an aberrant form of it. Bentham
described an immature pod as falcately linear,
about 13 mm long, glabrous.

In the protologue Harms referred Af. ulbri-
chiana to ser. Asperatae and suggested an affinity
to M. paludosa Benth. Its trimerous flowers, broad
spinule-tipped stipules and absence of para-
phyllidia point to a much closer relationship with
M. misera and M. cordistipula and their close
allies, from all of which M. ulbrichiang differs in
relatively numerous leaflets per pinna. It bears a
rather striking superficial resemblance to some
forms of M. paraguariae M. Micheli, a distantly
allopatric species technically dissimilar in te-
tramerous flowers and dilated paraphyllidia.
It seems likely that the epithet commemorates
Eberhard Ulbrich (1879-1952), Harms’s col-
league at Dahlem.

Mimosa minarum is closely related to M4. mi-

its own particular leaf-formula, short proper pet-

compact allopatric area of dispersal in campo
tupestre on the crest of Sa. do Espinhago and
that of the detached Sa. do Cabral. It is the only
member of its group known hitherto from Minas
Gerais. The morphological differentiation of this
whole series is not strong, and as material ac-
cumulates the taxonomic status of its members
will need reassessment.

Mimosa morroénsis is distinguished from im-
mediate relatives by the syndrome of Hexuously
humifuse stems, relatively long petioles, and nar-
row crowded pinnae. Mimosa ulbrichiana, known
to occur only a short distance to the northwest
of Morro do Chapeu, is a stiffly branched shrub-
let with longer pinna-rachises and an elongate 6—
11-seeded pod. Distantly allopatric Af. brevipin-
na resembles M. morroénsis in proportionately
long petioles, but the pinnae are shorter and more
distant, and the leaflets fewer, broader, and es-
sentially veinless. Mimosa minarum, found in
similar campo rupestre environment more than
600 km airline south of Morro do Chapeu in
Minas Gerais, has petioles no longer than the
first interpinnal segment of the leaf-stalk and
shorter, more distant pinnae, the whole leaf-out-
line being consequently at once longer and pro-
portionately narrower,
The foregoing description is based on the type-
collection only. Fragments of BRADE 37439
(=Duarte & Pereira 9192/10102, NY) from Mor-
ro de Chapeu, of which the greater part is M.
cordistipula, are probably referable to M4. mor-
roénsis, but have shorter, more scabrous indu-
mentum of glandular setulae only +0.2-0.6 mm
long.

Bentham chanced to notice on the type-col-
lection of M. brevipinna only tetramerous flow-
ers, but trimerous ones prevail, and the broad
stipules mucronate by a stout excurrent midrib
likewise indicate close relationship to other con-
stantly or at least characteristically trimerous mi-
mosas of northeastern Brazil, in particular to M.
misera, M. setuligera, M. borboremae, M. xique-
xiquensis and A4. morroénsis. Within this group
M. brevipinna most closely resembles M4. xigue-
xiquensis, M. setuligera and M. borboremae in
relatively long leaf-stalks and numerous short
pinnae, a leaf-formula that recalls tetramerous
M. gracilis var. gracilis. It differs from the first
of these three in capitellate (not spicate) inflo-
rescences, from the last in simply mucronate and
marginally entire (not spinulose-fimbriate) stip-
ules, and less securely from M4. setuligera (q.v.)
by differences in dispersal and relative propor-
tions of setae and viscid setulae.

Mimosa hirsuticaulis resembles M. morroénsis
in humistrate stems and in relatively long peti-
oles, but the leaves have only half as many pin-
nae. From the meager example available the pod
appears to have a much longer stipe (+7, not +1
mm). Monadelphy of the filaments through more
than 1 mm, as described from two isotypi, re-
quires confirmation from new collections.

This elegant prostrate mimosa is clearly akin
to M. brevipinna and M. borboremae, perhaps
not specifically distinct from the former, with
which it agrees closely in the entire mucronate
stipules, in leaf-formula, and in the random te-
tramerous flowers. The weak differential char-
acters that distinguish M. setuligera from M.
brevipinna are found in length and dispersal on
the plant of epidermal outgrowths: dense hispid
pubescence of the perhaps weaker and longer
stems; pinna-rachises glabrous except for a pe-
culiar pair of setae arising from points occupied
in most tetramerous Mimosae by the paraphy!l-
lidia (modified leaflets); and viscid-hispidulous
calyx and corolla-lobes. At present M. brevipinna
is known only from the type and Ad. setuligera
only from the type and one modern collection
(Heringer & al. 364, NY), so it is too earty to
assess the significance of the characters, which
may prove variable. The disparity in Jength of
peduncle to the associated leaf, thought by Harms
to be distinctive, is unlikely to prove a depend-
able character in the context of this group.

A delicately small-leaved, essentially herba-
ceous mimosa, M4. borboremae is instantly dis-
tinguished from all trimerous diplostemonous
kindred by its dilated stipules fimbriate by ex-
current nerves. The earliest known (but not dated)
collection, Houllet s.n. (M, from Pernambuco,
was doubtfully identified by Bentham as 7. grac-
itis, which may have somewhat similar foliage
but combined with entire stipules and tetram-
erous flowers.

A species of marked character, notable for xe-
romorphic shrubby habit, broad stipules, small
crowded leaves, and especially for the spinulose
tip of stiputes, icaf-stalks and pinnae. Even in its
restricted range M. cordistipula exhibits a diver-
sity of indumentum characteristic of many much
more widely dispersed members of the genus,
While the stems and foliage are constantly villous
in varying density, on Sa. da Jacobina they are
also glandular-setulose and the leaf-stalks are
dorsally aculeolate. On Sa. do Sincora pin-glands
and prickles are entirely wanting. On intervening
Sa. do Tombador, within a radius of 20 km of
Morro do Chapeu, the several known popula-
tions vary from both glandular and prickly (frwin
32348, NY) or glandular but not prickly (Afori
& Boom 14522, NY) to neither glandular nor
prickly Grwin 32650, NY).
In Flora brasiliensis Bentham described the
flower of 4. cordistipula as tetramerous, but
voiced the suspicion that they should be trim-
erous as in related species. I have found none
but trimerous flowers in the isotype at NY or in
any of seven modern collections studied.

Among planaltine diplostemonous mimosas
M. blanchetii is eminently singular in its pro-
portionately long and narrow leaves consisting
of as many as thirty pairs of pinnae not more
than six millimeters in length. Bentham associ-
ated it provisionally with the potentially multi-
and brevi-pinnate M. gracilis, but suspected that
its true affinity lay elsewhere. Mimosa gracilis
has tetramerous flowers and usually herbaceous
stems. The woody stems of M. blanchetii, the
spinulose stipules, the thick-textured veinless
leaflets, and the mostly (in many plants uniform-
ly) teimerous lowers collectively suggest a much
closer kinship to sympatric M4. cordistipula, which
differs, however, in dissimilar leaf-formula (only
3-7 pairs of pinnae) and in spinescent tips of
leaf-stalk and pinna-rachises,

In habit M. campicoia is reminiscent of the
common M. (ser. Paucifoliatae) dipiotricha, but
differs in fewer pinnae, fewer larger leaflets, pods
bome solitary or paired on each capitulum, and
most importantly in trimerous fiowers, the char-
acter that points to a kinship closer to unijugate
ser, Filipedes and especially to Af. pabstiana. The
species is known from four discrete parts of Cha-
pada Diamantina and is represented in each by
a more or less modified population. The most
distinct of these includes the type-collection from
Sa. do S. Ign4cio, in which the stems are minutely
incurved-puberulent as well as aculeate, the pet-
ioles are relatively short and not proximally di-
lated, and the leaflets are relatively broad. The
populations on Sa. do Curral Feio, Sa. do Tom-
bador, and Sa. da Agua da Rega differ collectively
from this in stems pilose with fine horizontal
hairs 0,25-1,2 mm long, petiole relatively long
and conspicuously dilated toward the base, and
relatively narrow leaflets, but they differ among
themselves in vesture of the pod. In the first this
is armed on replum with setaculei and hispid on
the valves with distally barbellate setae; in the

in the third it is both thinly pilose and aculeolate
on the replum, The type-collection stands well
apart from all subsequently collected specimens,
but is connected with them by the population on
Sa. do Curral Feio, for the pods of both bear the
very unusual setae branched at tip. These geo-
graphic and morphological divergences induce
me to recognize two varieties.

are weighty: lack of interpinnal spicules; lobulate
calyx; and in particular the relatively enormous,

erecl tawny setae minutely barbed above the

The flowers of M, pabstiana were recorded un-
equivecally by Pabst and Pereira as white. Gla-
ziou (1906, Lc. sub AF. invisa) called them pink,
but this may well refer only to the truly pink
flowers of genuine M/. invisa, with which he had
his nos, 23777 and 22641 confounded. The sup-
posedly pink flower at first suggested a possible
affinity to M. diplotricha, but M. pabstiana differs
decisively from this in relatively short petioles
and trimerous flowers. In habit it is reminiscent
of also trimerous ser. Ceratoniae, but it differs
gravely from these in Jeaf-formula and narrow
craspedia. Its true affinity seems to lie with AZ.
campicola, similar in everything except as spec-
ified in the key to ser. Campicolae.
The epithet celebrates and commemorates the
late Dr. Guido Pabst, who befriended H. S. Irwin
during his years of botanical exploration on the
Brazilian Planalto, and to whom the New York
Botanical Garden is indebted for invaluable gifts
of rare and unusual Leguminosae from south-
eastern Brazil.

This is a weak, weedy, inconspicuous mimosa
superficially resembling forms of pucica with
conjugate-pinnate, very sensitive leaves, but its
trimerous diplostemonous flowers indicate a true
affinity with M. patmetorum and its relatives in
ser. Filipedes. From M. paimetorum, with which
it agrees in delicately aculeolate stems and single
pair of pinnae, it differs in shorter stipules, in
smaller, more numerous leaflets, in shorter pe-
duncles, and in smaller capitula of puberulent
flowers. In general demeanor M. piscatonam bears
considerable resemblance to AM. pinetorum Stand],
of Belize, but this has turned out to be a hap-
lostemonous Eu-Mimosa.
Despite an essential similarity, the material of
M. piscatorum shows some variation in detail,
The leaflets of the type are pubescent on both
faces, but those of Venezuelan plants vary from
pubescent to glabrous. I found no interpinnal
spicule in most leaves of Sieyermark 108101, but
they appear in all other collections.
Mimosa piscatorum is currently better known
from Venezuela (5 collections) than from Brazil
(3 collections), but as all its close kindred are
concentrated in a relatively compact area of east-
ern Brazil it seems likely that its Venezuelan dis-
tribution is derived. In Lara it was discovered
on an experimental goat farm, but we know noth-
ing of the microhabitat elsewhere, except that all
known localities are situated in seasonally dry
climates similar to that prevailing in Pernam-
buco.

Since it was described in 1985 M. polydidyma
has been collected once again near Caeté-Acu,
this time bearing pods as well as flowers. The
fruit is that 10 be expected in a close relative of
M. palmetorum and M. filipes, species of the same
region characterized by conjugate pinnae, rela-
tively few leaflets, and spiculate leaf-stalks. It
differs from these in densely foliate stems and ia
dorsiventrally compressed, three-ribbed peti-
oles, from Mf. paimetorwm further in stiff un-
armed stems, and from Ad. filipes further in se-
tiform stipules.
In the protologue Dr, Harley’s collection num-

the former, which = CEPEC /0403, is the type-

Glabrous unarmed, remotely leafy stems, tiny
stipules, a single pair of pinnae with a spicule
between them, 3—7 pairs of glabrous leaflets and
tiny capitula contribute to the unique facies of
M. filifolia, Young plants, like those collected by
Martius, appear monocarpic, but older ones de-
velop a distinctly suffruticose base; probably none
are obligately annual. So far as present evidence
goes, the pod in populations of M. filipes from
Bahia northward has a perfectly smooth reptum
but the valves may be either simply puberulent,
both puberulent and granular, or simply granu-
lar. In Minas Gerais, from Grado Mogol south to
Diamantina, the replum is consistently fimbriate
along its dorsal and lateral ribs with weak seti-
form aculei, and the valves are consistently pu-
berulent. Perhaps two weakly differentiated va-
ricties may eventually be recognized.

The var. distachya is very close to var. quad-
rivalvis, but is commonly a coarser plant, with
larger leaves, a higher leaf-formula, and slightly
plumper capitula and longer pods. Its inland
forms (including type of L. pa/mer?) usually have
narrower and more glabrous leaflets than those
of the coastal lowlands, and at anthesis are dif-
ficult to distinguish from var. jaliscensis. The
present definition of var. distachya follows that
of McVaugh (1987: 245).

I here adopt a definition of var. jaliscensis by
its fruit (McVaugh, 1987, fig. 34, pro sp.), but
find it impossible to distinguish, except by ele-
vation of occurrence, flowering specimens from
lowland var. diffusa at the same stage of matu-
rity. More than half the available material is in
this ambiguous condition, and a sound taxono-
my for these closely related Mexican forms re-
quires much careful fieldwork and the correlation
of vegetative as well as carpological characters
with habitat and dispersal.

The geographically isolated var. urbaniana is
assumed to be native and endemic to Puerto
Rico because it differs from allopatric varieties
that resemble it in foliage by a fifth rib on the
pod’s reptum and by relatively short peduncles.
Its restricted known range on the island coin-
cides, interestingly and suggestively, with that of
Senna pendula var. stahlii (Urban) Irwin & Bar-
neby (1982: 393), a detached but only weakly
differentiated derivative of a complex highly di-
versified in South America. In length of peduncle
var. urbaniana is intermediate between South
American var. feptocarpa and North American
vars. distachya and angustata, but the high ovule
number (20-30) leans toward the South Amer-
ican elements of the species.

The var. tetragona resembles var. /eptocarpa

somewhat in leaf-formula and in relative lengths
of petiole and leaf-rachis. Specimens suggest that
it may be a coarser plant, and collectors have
noted only white filaments. Mexican var. dis-
tachya is similar in stout angulate stems, but has
fatter capitula borne on a longer peduncle.

Except for nomenclature, contingent on the
taxonomy, my concept of var, angustata
cides with Schrankia microphylla sensu Isely
(197 1a, 1973) except in this respect: I follow Tur-
ner (1959) by including Leptogiottis hailiana, the
lectotype of Schrankia angustata, and similar
east-Texan schrankias with leaf-formula of iii-
vi/12-18 and long narrow pods, which appear to
me indistinguishable from some populations in
Florida. These controversial taxa were trans-
ferred by Isely to Schrankia fatidens, but con-
tradict the contrasting morphological definitions
presented in his key and discussion (1971a: 234,
236). There appears to be a narrow pap in the
known dispersal of var. angustata in Louisiana
between the lower Mississippi and lower Sabine
rivers, but this gap cannot outweigh morpholog-
ical congruence between plants found to the east
and west.
The variation in length and armature of the
fruit of var. angustara was noted by Chapman,
and has given rise to a number of proposed seg-
regates; these, however, as Isely has ably dem-
onstrated, lack geographic patterns, except in-
sofar as the state with short, usually burrlike but
sometimes only thinly aculeate pod, is not en-
countered at the southern and western extremi-
ties of the dispersal range. No significant corre-
lation has been found between length, girth,
pubescence, and armature of fruit, which vary
independently of one another. Occasional plants
in Florida have inciptently elevated midrib on
back of leaflets, suggesting passage into var. flor-
idana.

Relatively short and numerous pinnae, and a
consequently narrow leaf-outline, are the prin-
cipal characters that distinguish var. accidentalis.
The valves of the pod vary from distinctly nar-
rower to quite as wide as the replum; at the latter
extreme the fruit closely approximates that of
var. platycarpa and var. latidens. Both of these
have as a rule fewer pinnae, and var. /atidens
also fewer leaflets per pinna and smaller capitula.
At the northeastern edge of its range in Texas
var. occidentalis appears to be vicariant with var.
nuttalli!, extremely similar except for prominent
dorsal venulation of the leaflets. The relatively
large seeds, noticed by McGregor (in Fl. Great
Plains 410, 1986), are notable but not invariably
diagnostic,

The var. nelsonii is a critical entity, poised
morphologically between vars. /atidens, angus-
tata, and occidentalis. It agrees with var. latidens
in number of pinnae per leaf, but in number of
leaflets per pinna and in relatively long and thinly
aculeate, long-beaked pod it approaches the Tex-
an form of var. angustata; the long seeds are in
the size-range of var. occidentalis. It contributed
to the amorphous (because over-comprehensive)
concept of Schrankia latidens proposed by Isely
(197 1a).
The status of Schrankia subinermis requires
field-study. The type differs from other examples
of var. nelsonii in having only one pair, not two
or three pairs, of pinnae per leaf, and the leaflet-
number (in few surviving leaves) is transitional
to var. datidens. The Sarge seeds are those of var.
nelsoni.

The four species of ser. Spiciflorae lacking pet-
iolar nectaries that were known to Bentham in
1876 (p. 407) together with the subsequently de-
scribed M. drevispica and M. esmeraidae are
essentially homogeneous in structure of flower
and pod, and differ in relatively labile characters
ofleaf-formula, length of flower-spikes, and leaf-
iness of the mature inflorescence. These unstable
characters vary independently of one another,
with the result that Bentham’s diagnostic phrases
no longer apply to much of the material that has
accumulated in the past century. The group is
here treated as one species that shows a degree
of racial differentiation in its farflung range. South
of Amazonia the flower-spikes tend to be elon-
gate and the whole inflorescence tends to be ex-
serted from foliage, whereas in Guayana, Ven-
ezuela and adjoiming Colombia the individual
spike is either contracted or relatively few-flow-
ered, and the majority of peduncles are early
surpassed by their subtending leaf, the pods con-
sequently immersed in foliage. I recognize these
internally variable assemblages as the geographic
subspecies invisa and spiciflora, respectively.
Within each subspecies there is wide variation
in leaf-formula, leaf-size and length of flower-
spike, in pubescence of stem and pod, and in
width of pod, but these features are insecurely
correlated or obviously not so. The visually ar-
resting differences in leaf-formula are rather well
linked with dispersal in the range of subsp. invisa,
Jess well in that of subsp. spiciflora, but in both
are loosely correlated with length of the floral
axis. In spite of ambiguous individual specimens
it seems desirable to maintain two varieties in
each subspecies, these corresponding more or less
closely with the four species known to Bentham.

The var, spiciflora varies in pubescence and in
width of pod. Most of the known specimens from
north-central Venezuela, including the types of
M. spiciflora and Schrankia glabra, have gla-
brous stems; and the pods, if present, are 12-16
mm wide. The types of AM. esrneraldae and M.
brevispica have densely pilosulous stems and leaf-
stalks, but so does the one known collection from
the state of Monagas; moreover, Pittier 9775 (NY)
from Caracas has the same type of indument but
thinner. The pods collected along Rio Branco in
Brazil are a littke wider than any so far known
from Venezuela, attaining widths of 15-22 mm.
No differential character other than pubescence
was invoked either by Harms or Britton to dis-
tinguish M. brevispica and AM. esmeraldae from
M. spiciffora, all of which have essentially the
same jeaf-formula, inflorescence, and corolla.

At first sight 7. lemniscata suggests some form
af M. invisa subsp. invisa, with which it agrees
in pentamerous haplostemonous flowers and
broad ribbon-like (whence the epithet) pods; but
it differs in strictly capitellate flowers and white,
not pink filaments, less exserted from the corolla.
It is more closely related to the also Colombian
M. antioquiensis, but cannot be referred there
with comfort, differing in the effuse efoliate pan-
icle of capitula, in calyx less than half as long as
sympatric populations of M. antioguiensis, in
white (not pinkish-red) corolla with ovate, al-
most plane (not linear-involute) lobes, and in
white (not pink) filaments. Its leafless panicle of
small white capitula recalls 4. (ser. Bimucrona-
tae) bimucronara, but the plant is otherwise very
different in armament, in stamen-number, and
in much longer and wider pod.

Mimosa leptocarpa made two appearances in
North American Flora, the flowering state as a
monotypic group 4rgillotrophae, the fruiting state
as Neomimosa leptocarpa. In North America it
was morphologically isolated until the recent dis-
covery in Oaxaca of M, antioguiensis, and its
connection with the South American species of
ser. Plurijugae escaped notice. Its mostly pen-
tamerous flowers that give rise to broadly ribbon-
shaped, stipitate and about 10-12-ovulate pods
combined with elaborately bipinnate leaves and
cat’s-claw armament of stems and leaf-stalks are
in close agreement with M. antioquiensis and M.
lemniscata, from both of which it differs, how-
ever, in fewer larger leaflets and isolated habitat
along the coastal plain of Colima and Guerrero.
In the limited number of flowers available for
dissection I found the androecium for the most
part strictly haplostemonous, one to three and
exceptionally four complementary stamens ap-
pearing randomly in some lower fiowers.

The discovery of M. antioquiensis introduced
the new dimension of globose flowerheads into
a series until that time defined by amentiform
flower-spikes. The capitula of 4. antioguiensis
can be visualized as the terminus in a progressive
shortening of the floral axis that starts with (or
perhaps more accurately culminates in) the long
loose spikes of M4. invisa subsp. invisa south of
Amazonia and passes through ever shorter and
denser stages in A4. invisa subsp. spiciflora of
northern South America. This sequence, which-
ever way it may be read, is nearly continuous;
but M. antioguiensis and M. lemniscata are dis-
tinguished collectively from the Af. invisa com-
plex by short filaments correlated with spherical
flower-heads, and A4. antioguiensis from all other
Plurijugae by its involute and therefore appar-
ently very narrow corolla-lobes.
Mimosa antioguiensis is an at least superfi-
cially variable species, of which I have seen few
complete specimens, these moreover from wide-
ly separated localities. It may prove divisible into
geographic varieties, one centered in the lower
Magdalena valley in Colombia, and the other on
the Pacific slope in southern Mexico and El Sal-
vador. The typical form has a deeply campan-
ulate calyx (+1 mm) and craspedia about 90-
130 x 11-13 mm, whereas the calyx in Central
America is only half as long or less and the body
of the craspedium is 45-90 x 7-12 mm, com-
posed of correspondingly fewer (8-15, not 12-
20) articles. My colleague R. Grether informs me
that there are distinct pubescence forms of Af.
antioquiensis in Oaxaca correlated with micro-
habitat, and that occasional tetramerous and
hexamerous flowers have been observed there. I
leave the solution of taxonomic problems in AZ,
antioguiensis to Dra, Grether, who has oppor-
tunities for field-study and access to fuller ma-
terial, The foregoing description attempts to por-
tray the range of variation directly observed in
the course of this study.
The epithet antioguiensis was so written on the
type-sheet by Dr. Rudd herself, but was pub-
lished as antioguensis. I here adopt as a prefer-
able orthographic variant what is certainly the
etymologically correct and presumably the in-
tended spelling.

As Burkart has remarked, M. cylindracea re-
sembles M. scabretia in aspect of foliage and its
gray indumentum, while very different in the spi-
cate inflorescence. It is somewhat precariously
distinguished from M. furfuracea by more ap-
pressed vesture of stelliform setae, by narrower
spikes, persistent bracts, slightly larger calyx, and
on the average more numerous and smaller leaf-
lets. The known ranges of the two species are far
from coextensive, but overlap in eastern S. Paulo
and adjacent Minas Gerais, and both species have
been collected in the Brazilian Federal District,
Possibly they may represent aspects of one poly-
morphic species.
Martius’s collection from Bahia that Bentham
cited (1876: 354) as AZ. cylindracea has become
the type of M4. coruscocaesia Bameby.

When I first encountered Giaziou 8651, mis-
identified as M. verrucosa, I felt confident that
the specimens represented an undescribed taxon
of sect. Calothamnos, but the immaturity of the
inflorescence precluded sure observation of the
flower-structure. Toward the end of this study I
came across confirmatory material in the Na-
tional Herbarium at Rio de Janeiro, which, al-
though again immature, has flowers on the verge
of opening, sufficiently advanced to show that
they are pentamerous, unlike those of other spi-
cate Calothamnos, and haplostemonous, unlike
those of M. verrucosa. Mimosa myuros, so named
for the extremely narrow mouse-tail flower-
spikes, is evidently a close relative of M4. cylin-
dracea. The leaf-formula is similar, except that
both pinnae and leaflets attain slightly higher
numbers, and the indumentum is similar, except
less dense. The flower-spikes at comparable age
and state of development are only 3 (not 4.5-5)
mi in diameter. The extremely small size of the
flower and its pentamerous perianth are, how-
ever, the decisive differential characters.

The obviously close relationship of M. fierfura-

ter, In Af. furfuracea the length and color of setae
on leaflets and pods are variable, but taxonomic
recognition of the extreme states seems hardly
justified. Consequently I here commit to syn-
onymy both var. paranensis, a robust state with
pallid indumentum, and var. catharinensis, de-
scribed from the southernmost known popula-
tion of the species, which has relatively small
leaves and relatively short indumentum on leaf-
lets and pods, these moreover being exception-
ally narrow (+4 mm) and appearing when im-
mature more strongly compressed. All are
essentially uniform in leaf-formula and inflores-
cence.

Mimosa barretoi is readily distinguished from

leaflets and thick spikes of relatively large flow-

The concept of Af. aurivillus embodied in the
foregoing description is much wider than any
hitherto proposed. It would have been preferable
to maintain the traditional taxonomy and, fol-
lowing Burkart (1964), continue to recognize as
distinct species Af. aurivillus, M. calothamnos
and M. sordida, but difficulties have arisen in
modern collections. Al! elements of Af. aurivillus
sensu fato have essentially the same flower and
pod, and differ among themselves principally in
leaf-formula, in length, density and disposition
of branched trichomes, and in outline of the ca-
pitula, which are seldom truly globose but vary
caprictously from plumply ovoid to narrowly el-
lipsoid and to twice as long as their diameter.
None of these character states is stabilized and
each varies independently of the others, with pre-
dictably perplexing results. Moreover the outline
of the capitulum, which previously has been em-
ployed as a key character, is especially unreliable;
the trichomes vary subtly among populations
otherwise similar; and even leaf-formula must
be cautiously evaluated, because lush leaves be-
low the flowering nodes are sometimes Jarger and
more complex than later ones.
Within the collective species can be discerned
two principal types, the ranges of which overlap
widely in central Minas Gerais. These are awri-
villus sens. str., which has short leaf-stalks and
relatively few leaflets coarsely thinly stellate on
both faces and ranges from Sa. da Caraga north
into southern Bahia; and var. calothamnos, which
has relatively long leaf-stalks and more numer-
ous leafiets densely finely pannose-tomentulose
beneath and ranges from Diamantina southward
to Sa. dos Orgaos in Rio de Janeiro and into
adjoining S. Paulo. Where these are sympatric
they are often readily distinguishable and behave
as discrete species. But in central and northemn
Minas Gerais have arisen combinations of char-
acters, possibly by way of introgression, which
bridge the discontinuity between them. The en-
tity described below as var. calothamnoides has
the leaf-formula of var, auriviflus but the vesture
of var. calothamnos. The type of var. sordescens
shows the vesture of var. aurivillus coupled with
the Jeaf-formula of var. calothamnos. Mimosa
sordida and M. mogolensis are like var. sordes-
cens except that the stellate hairs are smaller and
fier, and in the second confined to the hypo-
phylium.

to Sa. da Caraga near 20°30’S in s.-centr. Minas
Gerais.—Fl. X-IV(-?), the fruit long persistent.
The var. aurivitins varies notably in length of
arborescently branched or plumose setae that
clothe the stems, leaf-stalks, axes of inflores-
cence, and pods, and to lesser degree in maxi-
mum leaflet-number. All samples of it collected
on Sa, da Caraga have longer cauline setae to 2-
4,5(-5) mm long and either glabrescent at tip or
perfectly smooth beyond middie, commonly in-
termixed with shorter substellate setae. Here the
longer pinnae have five or six pairs of leaflets,
whereas on Sa. da Lapa peduncularis var.
rufescens) they rise to nine pairs, without change
in vesture. Within a 50 kilometer radius of Dia-
mantina, from which region many collections
have been made in recent years, the cauline setae
vary from about 0.6 to 2 mm in length and are
plumulose from base to tip, while the leaflets are
about 6-9 pairs. On Pico de Almas in Bahia the
selae are as at Diamantina but the leaflets rise
to 10-11 pairs. Around S. Jofo da Chapada, a
few kilometers north of Diamantina, Irwin col-
lected three sets of specimens that show a col-
lective range of 0.6-4.5 mm in maximum length
of setae and 5-6 pairs in maximum leaflet-num-
ber. On Caraga the pod is plumosely setose with
trichomes to 1-2 mm jong, not significantly dif-
ferent from a recorded range of 0.4-2 mm in the
vicinity of Diamantina. It seems impossible to
extract further subspecific taxa from the matrix
of var. aurivillus, though the populations isolated
(as at present appears) on Pico de Almas may
have some claim to taxonomic status.

The type of M. aurivillus var. sordescens, col-
lected in very early flower and lush leaf in June,
and that of M. serdida, collected in full flower in
November and lacking the probably larger pri-
mary cauline leaves, differ somewhat in pubes-
cence, size of leaflets, and outline of capitula. The
stellate trichomes of var. sordescens are relatively
coarse, as in var. aurivillus, and the capitula of
4M. sordida are proportionately longer. They are
alike in leaf-formula, and the localities are not
more than fifty kilometers apart in the adjoining
municipios of Diamantina and Itamarandiba.
Mimosa mogolensis, known to me from the pro-
tologue and from an approximate topotype
(Hatschbach 41420, NY) is interpreted as a mi-
nor variant with leaflets glabrous on the upper
face. It is otherwise like the type of M. sordida.
The taxonomic significance in this group of rel-
atively long and short flowering receptacle and
consequently more or less elongate-ellipsoid ca-
pitulum has been overemphasized.

The type of var. warmingil was associated by
Bentham in Flora brasiliensis with that of AZ.
sordida, but differs materially in very short pet-
ioles and particularly in the minute flowers borne
in narrowly oblong (almost cylindric) heads and
in the exceptionally narrow pod. The pod is rem-
iniscent of Af. daleoides, rather than of other va-
ricties of M. aurivilius, but the pinnae are mostly
bijugate. Indumentum of the leaflets is that of
var. sordida and var. aurivillus.

The var. calothamnoides is crucial to the clas-
sification of M. auriviltus sensu lato because in
it are combined characters previously thought to
distinguish the closely related Af. aurivillus sens.
str., Af. calothamnos, and M. sordida: the short
leaf-stalks and relatively few leaflets of
the dorsally tomentose leaflets of calothammnos,
thinly stetlate above and of the same number as
in sordida (=var. sordescens of this account). The
vars. aurivillus and calothamnos ate sympatric
in the range of var. calothamnoides, which may
perhaps represent a set of localized, self-perpet-
uating hybrids. However, where var. calotham-
nos and var. aurivillus coincide further south, as
on Sa. da Caraca, no intermediates have been
detected. A specimen from Sa. Caparaé in south-
eastern Minas (H. C de Lima 2575, RB), super-
ficially similar, requires critical revision.

Mimosa peduncularis is very closely related to
the M. aurivillus complex and perhaps better
viewed as an aberrant element of it. The smooth
castaneous, non-plumose cauline setae com-
bined with very slender capitula 3-5 mm diam.
are visually striking, but 4. aurivillus var. war-
mingi has equally small flower-heads and ulti-
mately the sole reliable difference is in the in-
dumentum. The disposition of the species can
well be deferred, however, until we have further
contemporary evidence of its stature, habitat,
dispersal, and of the constancy within a popu-
lation of smooth setae.

mm, the interpinnal segments (when present) 4—
10(-11) mm; pinnae either 1(-2)- or (1-)2C3)-
jug., when more than 1 pair either subequilong

M. caledendron. Peduncies 1.5-3.5 em; capitula
ellipsoid or subglobose, without filaments 4-11

hiscent articles 5-8 mm long; seeds black sub-
lustrous 4.2-5 x 2.8-3.5 mm.
Mimosa leprosa is closely related both to M.
calodendron and to M. aurivillus var. calotham-
nos, fesembling the former in the deltate stipules
but differing in the dull upper face of leafiets,
shorter narrower capitula, and especially in prox-
imally glabrate or thinly retrostrigulose corollas.
In habit and outline of capitula it is intermediate
between M. aurivillus var. calothamnos and M.
calodendron and, if subordinated to either, pre-
cludes a satisfactory definition of either, So far
as known, M. leprosa is endemic to Sas. da Pie-
dade and Caraga, where it occupies the habitat
of M. caiodendron in the serras immediately ad-
jacent to Belo Horizonte, that is, the bare rock-
ledges and stony iron-rich soils of the summits
above 1700 meters. Mimosa calodendron also
occurs in both these serras, but is definitely re-
corded only from below 1600 meters.
The populations of M. /eprosa on the two ser-
fas are not identical, but have diverged to the
point where they can usefully be recognized tax-
onomically.

iI,
I here return to Bentham’s original narrow
concept of M. calodendron, and consider his var.
leprosa as a sibling species that replaces it on Sa.
da Piedade. The concentration of the season's
foliage into short, densely leafy and often abrupt-
ly flexuous terminal branches, the lustrous epi-
phyllum of the leaflets contrasting with their pan-
nosely pallid-tomentose hypophyllum, the
plumper capitula, the corolla stellate overall and
not merely on the lobes, and the slightly deeper
calyx seem to constitute an adequate specific syn-
drome, Where Af, calodendron is sympatric, on
Sa. da Caraga, with Af. /eprosa, this is represented
by its var. parviceps, clearly different in leaves
well distributed along extended hornotinous
branches and extremely small capitula 3-4.5, not
mm in diameter.

first pair (1-)2-3 mm distant from minute subu-
late paraphyllidia immersed in setulae, all sessile

slightly accrescent upward through the capitu-
lum, mostly 4-merous 4-androus but the corolla
exceptionally 5-merous, only a few distal ones
bisexual; calyx membranous, shallowly campan-
ulate-patelliform 0.15—0,2 mm glabrous; corollas
obovoid-turbinate firm-textured, densely sor-
did-stellate externally overall, 1.6-2.2 mm, the

lum and from one another, falling as dehiscent
articles 4.5-5 mm long; seeds obtusely com-
pressed-rhomboid +3 x 3 mm, the testa dull
brown.
In most characters of habit and foliage Af. ma-
cedoana seems scarcely more than a glabrate
phase of M. aurivilius sensu lato, but it is further
distinguished by the extremely small capitula, in
this respect nearer to M. chrysastra, which see
for comment. The type of M4. macedoana has 1-
2 pairs of pinnae per leaf, but among leaves of
subsequent collections from Sa. do Cipé there is
one example ofa single pair of pinnae in all leaves
and others of as many as four pairs per leaf. In
all of these the leafiet-blades are narrower, or at
least not wider, than the space between succes-
sive pairs. The type of MM. sordida var. glabres-
cens, also from Sa. do Cipé, differs in leaf-for-
mula of ii-iii/17-19, with the more numerous
leaflets more crowded along the rachis and con-
sequently imbricate. This has, however, the tiny
capitula of Af. macedoana, to which it seems
more closely akin than to M, sordida (=M. au-
rivillus var, sordescens of this account), and for
this reason is transferred.

The morphology, dispersal and economic vir-
tues of Af, scabrella have been most fully de-
scribed by Burkart and by Lins in the places cited
above. A curious form under cultivation in Pa-
rana (mun. Bocaiva do Sul, Moreira & A, Miguel
NY) has pod-valves grossly vernicose as
well as stellate.
Burkart (1948: 225) plausibly suggested that
the type-locality of M. scabrefia is near Lages in
Sta. Catarina, where Sello must have encoun-
tered it on his fifth voyage.

Detached flowering branchlets of 4, eriocarpa
suggest a diminutive or starveling Af. scabrella,
of which the leaf-formula is sometimes similar.
The mature plant, however is a slender shrub,
never arborescent; the capitula, commonly sub-
tended by one or more rows of empty bracts, are
fewer-flowered and narrower, and the one-seed-
ed pods concealed in a dense mantle of plumose
setae, suggesting pinkish insect-galls when fresh,
are perfectly characteristic.

Mimosa urticaria (the epithet alludes to the
type-locality) appears well characterized by con-
jugate pinnae bore on a relatively long petiole,
expansive thin-textured concolorous leaflets
thinly stellate on each face, corollas stellate from
base upward, and lack of staminodia between
the monadelphous fertile stamens. In general as-
pect it recalls M, bathyrrhena, atso endemic (so
far as known) to upland Parana, but this is clearly
different in bijugate pinnae, longer pinnae and
floral bracts, and staminodia between the fila-
ments. The common . pilulifera var. pseudin-
cana has one pair of pinnae like Af. urticaria, but
petioles only 1-4 mm Jong and strongly bicolored
leaflets scarcely half as big.

Following the lead of Lins (1984: 40) I here
return to Bentham’s inclusive concept of a M.
pilulifera variable in pubescence, flower-size and
width of pod that is dispersed from central Minas
Gerais south to Urnguay and adjoining Argen-
tina. Burkart divided the corresponding material
into a narrowly defined, southern riparian low-
land M, pilulifera sens. restr. and a mostly mon-
tane-campestrian M]. pseudincana dispersed along
the Atlantic uplands from Rio Grande do Sul to
central Minas Gerais; he emphasized principally
habitat and denser indumentum as specific cri-
teria of the latter. Lins, however, found no sig-
nificant pattern of differences, and reduced Bur-
kart’s M. piludifera and M. pseudincana, together
with the minor segregates Mf. aparadensis and
M. simulans, to one polymorphic taxon. Study
of this problem led me independently toa middle
ground. All specimens of the complex seen from
Sta. Catarina northward plainly differ from the
riparian plant of the lower Parana River and Plate
Estuary in smaller capitula, denser dorsal indu-
mentum of the leaflets, and a pod averaging a
little narrower. In Rio Grande do Sul specimens
ambiguous in one or other respect become fre-
quent, but it seems realistic and desirable, in
spite of these, to maintain two varieties. Bur-
kart’s less significant segregates are mentioned
further under var. pseudincana. Lins’s descrip-
tion of the “semente ... 11 [X] 6 mm must
refer to the articles of the pod, not to the seed
itself.

Characters as given in key to varieties.
On stream- and river-banks, in moist thickets,
at margin of gallery woodland, sometimes form-
ing dominant populations, discontinuously
widespread along the coast ranges of s.-e, Brazil,
from the headwaters of rio Grande in Minas Ge-
Tais to n.-e. (perhaps centr.) Rio Grande do
Sul, according to Burkart (1.c.) to Uruguay, in S.
Paulo ascending to 1770 m on Sa. da Bocaina,
n.-ward from Parana not or seldom below 700
m but perhaps lower s,-ward.—Fl. in tropical
latitudes mostly ILI-V, s.-ward [V-VIII, but in-
termittently at other seasons.
Among the synonymis listed under var. pseu-
dincana, the var. discolor is the least substantial
variant, a form with leaflets glabrous and lus-
trous (not thinly stellate) on the upper face; it is
the predominant form in eastern Parana and ex-
tends thence both north and southward, but no-
where displaces completely the typical form. Mi-
mosa@ aparadensis has the small capitula of var.
pseudincana, but glabrous dorsally on the
posterior side of midrib, where covered in sleep
by the feafiet next below it on the rachis, and is
in this respect intermediate to var. pilulifera. The
concentration of leaves toward the end of the
branches, said by Burkart to be distinctive, is
matched in specimens with the indumentum of
var. pseudincana. Mimosa simulans, known to
me only from the protologue, was distinguished
from M. pseudincana by a narrower fruit remi-
niscent of M. daleoides, but width of pod is plau-
sibly interpreted by Lins (1984: 43) as a function
of maturity, perhaps influenced by ecology.

In the context of related species with conju-
gate-pinnate leaves, most of which are of extra-
tropical dispersal, the distinctive characters of
M. psiftacina are: a) thick-textured leaflets gla-
brous above, 3-nerved beneath and there thinly
stellate on that part of the blade not covered by
the leaflet next below it; b) ellipsoid, not globose
capitula; corolla stellate on the lobes but retro-
strigulose on the tube below the sinuses; and d)
filaments free to the base. Mimosa chrysastra
var. chrysasira, known only from Mt. Itambé in
central Minas Gerais, resembles it overall, but
has leaflets glabrous on both faces, glabrate (not
tomentose) stems, globose capitula, corolla sim-
ply retrostrigulose, and shortly monadelphous
filaments. Mimosa daleoides, which ranges south-
and westward from Sao Paulo, has similar (though
generally longer) capitula, but narrower leaflets
tomentulose on both faces, a pod only 2-3 (not
3.5-4.3) mm wide, and once again monadel-
phous filaments, Mimosa pilulifera var. pseudin-
cana, which ranges feebly north into southern
Minas Gerais, differs in conspicuously bicolored
1-nerved leaflets glabrous above and tomentu-
lose beneath, and capitula exactly globose, but
has similar pod and filaments. The thick-tex-
tured leaflets thinly stellate where not covered
by the next lower leaflet forcibly suggest distantly
allopatric M, pilulifera var. pilulifera, but this (cf.
Burkart, 1948: 122, fig, 18, lam. 12) again has
little globose capitula and essentially 1-nerved
leaflets.
Mimosa psittacina is represented in the Paris
herbarium by three sheets of specimens so sim-
ilar among themselves as to appear parts of one
collection, but they are differently and ambigu-
ously labelled. The sheet designated holotypus
consists of several branchlets ticketed with the
number 480d, but locality-data are lacking. The
second sheet bears Saint-Hilaire’s number C'/
489; the single stem thereon is ticketed 490d with
query. The number must be mistaken, for C’/
489 is described in Saint-Hilaire’s fieldbook (P)
as a papilionacea. The third sheet repeats the
corrupt number C'/489 and the specimen is tick-
eted 490d with query, to which is added the word
Papagayo. Saint Hilaire’s fieldbook D records
feld-numbers +490-515 taken in the Sa. da
Mantiqueira in the general vicinity of Ibitipoca
and Baependi, where Sa, do Papagaio is also lo-
cated. Circumstantial evidence points to a com-
mon origin for all three sheets on Sa. do Papa-
gaio.

A matted shrublet, related to M. pilulifera but
notably different in habit, habitat, and dense stel-
late indumentum, M. rocae is, with M. tandilen-
sis, the species of Mimosa extending furthest south
in South America, to latitude 38°30’S.
Mimosa rocae was collected for the first time
by Friedrich Setlow, perhaps in Uruguay, but no
exact locality is on record. Sellow’s material in
the Hooker herbarium at Kew was annotated by
Bentham as M. incana.

Mimosa berroi resembles M. incana in leaf-
formula and indumentum but is apparently a
smaller plant, certainly different in plumper ca-
pitula, broad interfloral bracts, longer corollas,
yellowish (not pink) filaments free almost to base,
dilated stigma, and valvately dehiscent pod. Ac-
cording to Lins (1984; 22) there should be no
interseminal septa in the pod of M. berroi, but
they are evident in the specimens seen by me
and were both described and illustrated in the
protologue. Mimosa pilulifera, which is sympat-
ric with M. berroi in Tacuarembé and also has
yellowish, essentially free filaments, is more thin-
ly lepidote, with leaflets glabrous above, has ca-
pitula mostly geminate and smaller (without fil-
aments 4.5-6, not 7-9 mm diam.), and the
appressed-stellate (not burrlike) craspedia break
up into free-falling articles.

As shown by Burkart (1964, Le.), M4. incana
is readily distinguished from related and habital-
ly similar Cafothamnos by pink filaments mona-
delphous at base and a burrlike fruit coarsely
hispid overall with broad-based, subcontiguous
or sometimes discrete setae. The very similar M4.
berroi, closely sympatric with Mf. incana in Uru-
guay and adjacent Rio Grande do Sul, is said to
be a smaller shrublet, certainly different in hav-
ing yellow filaments free to base and an apically
dilated, not filiform style. The present treatment
closely follows that of Burkart (1964), who un-
ravelled the confused history and nomenclature
of the species. Lins (1984: 35) cited, perhaps in-
advertently, as Af. incana the Paraguayan col-
lections Hassler 4583, 9244 and Fiebrig 5629,
all representing the distinct (though also pink-
flowered) M. flocculosa Burkart, the last being
isotypic. I have no evidence that genuine AZ. in-
cana extends to Paraguay.
The typus of M. incana was a Sello collection
lacking serial number and of unrecorded prov-
enance. Malme (1931: cited a Sello 3219
from Rio Grande do Sul, perhaps part of the
type-collection of Acacia incana Sprengel, but
gave no exact locality.
Fruits of Af. iricana are inordinately variable
in width of valves and replum and in density,
length and scabrous ornamentation of the setae
on the valves, 1 have not the material to deter-
mine whether this variability is related to dis-
persal or to habitat. Sterile, galled fruits, often
forming dense spherical clusters (Berro 4628, K),
have been described by Burkart and Lins.

types of trichome highly variable; seeds trans-
verse or obliquely basipetal, plumply ovoid 3.5-
4.7(-5) x 2.8-4 mm, the brown or livid-casta-
neous testa smooth lustrous.
My concept of M4, setosa incorporated in the
foregoing description is much more comprehen-
sive than that of Bentham, for it includes not
only unarmed . setosa sensu stricto and its var.
nitens, but also aculeate M. paludosa, anda num-
ber of more local, hitherto undescribed forms.
When Bentham described Jf. setosa he possessed
only one flowering collection, and assumed, be-
cause of its general similarity in foliage and in-
dumentum to the then-known members of ser.
Pachycarpae, that it would have the thick-walled,
non-articulate pod of that series. In this he was
mistaken, as the fruit turned out to be essentially
identical with that of M4. paludosa, which he re-
ferred, because of its armed stems and the cras-
pedial dehiscence of the fruit, to ser. Asperatae,
A difference between Af. setosa and M. paiudosa
known to but not emphasized by Bentham lay
in the calyx, which is pappiform in the former
and almost or quite devoid of marginal setulae
in the latter. However calyces of intermediate
form are now known, and that of M. setosa var.
nitens is essentially that of M. paludosa. The
morphological basis for treating M. setosa and
M. paiudosa as separate species has shrunk to
difference between aculeate and unarmed states
of otherwise essentially similar plants.
Unlike Bentham we are now in position to
know with close approach to exactness the geo-
graphical ranges of the various elements of the
M. setosa-paludosa complex. These, like the sub-
species and varieties of Af. somnians, but on a
smaller scale, form a concentric series, focussed
on the highlands of the Tocantins-Sao Francisco-
Paranda watershed. The outermost ring corre-
sponds with the limit of the species and of its
subsp. paludosa—as in M. somnians it is the
armed type that is furthest dispersed from the
center of diversity. Within the range of subsp.
paiudosa and only slightly less extensive lies that
of subsp. setosa. And again within or immedi-
ately adjacent to the last lie subsp. granitica,
subsp. urbica, and severa] minor derivatives of
subsp. setosa,

This visually striking but technically weak va-

to.M. adenotricha, but differs in sparse armament
of subrecurved (not acroscopic) aculei and in the
nature of the pod, which breaks at maturity into
free-falling articles. It seems to differ from var.
patudosa not only in xeric habitat and life-form,
but by flowering in the dry season (April-June).

M. setosa Bentham, 1842, sensu parum auc-
to.—Typus infra sub var. seftosa indicatur.
Characters as given in key to subspecies and
varieties.
My concept of subsp. setosa is embodied pri-
marily in those viscid multifoliolate Setosae in
which these characters coincide: a triple pubes-
cence of plain setae, glandular setulae and villi,
but no prickles; thin-textured veinless or dorsally
faintly costate leaflets spaced to mm apart
along rachis; an externally glabrous pappiform
calyx; corolla lobes charged dorsally with a few
subsessile or short-stalked glands intermixed with
plain setulae; and a relatively thin-walled, plano-
compressed pod of which the villosulous and
thinly setose valves break irregularly or incom-
pletely into articles wider than long. On this gen-
eral theme occurs considerable variation in mu-
tual proportions of the three types of trichome,
and a number of populations do not answer per-
fectly to all the ideal morphological conditions.
Further, the floral bracts vary from about two-
thirds as long to fully as long as the expanded
bisexual corollas, the capitulum consequently
varying pricr to anthesis from conelike to mori-
form.
Around the nucleus of exactly or nearly typical
subsp. sefosa, which is most common and most
clearly differentiated in southern Goias and Dis-
trito Federal, are clustered several forms in one
way or another departing from the idealized for-
mula of the subspecies, In north-central Sao Pau-
lo the pod, elsewhere sessile or almost so, be-
comes markedly stipitate, and interpinnal spicules
are lacking from the leaf-stalk, This form was
known to Bentham, but referred to the related
M. melanocarpa, always distinguished by an ex-
ternally silky-setose calyx, it is described below
as var, pseudomelas. Locally in western Minas
Gerais the calyx is reduced, quite or nearly, to
the tube, as in subsp. patudosa, and both plain
and gland-tipped setae disappear simultaneously
from stem and leaf-stalk; this corresponds to var.
nitens Benth, An anomalous form that retains
the pappiform calyx of subsp. setosa but has lost
all glandular pubescence below the pod is here
described from central Minas Gerais as var. ru-
pigena.

Ihave segregated this variety under the epithet
pseudomelas because it was confused by Ben-
tham with 44. melanocarpa. The type specimen
was first identified by Bentham as M. setosa, but
later transferred to Af. melanocarpa, perhaps be-
cause of its stipitate pods. Theoretically, var.
pseudomelas might be interpreted as a link con-
necting M. setosa with M. melanocarpa, but it is
allopatric to both. I surmise that it represents an
independent mutation derived directly from
subsp. sefosa.

The var. nitens is visually striking but poorly

replace var. setosa in western Minas Gerais, oc-
cupying territory between those of var. setosa
and var. pseudometas, Weddell’s specimen la-
belled Cachocira do Campo is under suspicion
for this reason: it is dated 1844, when Weddell

through Patrocinio in early February of that year.

The var. rupigena may be merely a casual
giandless variant of var. setosa, of which it re-
tains the habit and pappiform calyx, but its oc-
currence at the far eastern periphery of the range
of subsp. setosa in a specialized habitat and in a
region of pronounced endemism suggests some-
thing more substantial. Further collections, ob-
viously, are needed.
In addition to varieties of subsp. setasa for-
mally described, I must mention two groups of
aberrant specimens which deserve further study.
Two collections from Chapada dos Veadeiros
(Irwin 32231, 33045, distributed as M. setosa
fma b, NY) have setose stem-pubescence sup-
pressed or almost so, and corollas setulose but
eglandular. These plants, from a locality at the
northern known limit of the whole species’ range,
were coming into flower in late March at ele-
vations probably above 1200 m. Pods are re-
quired for positive identification. Four callec-
tions from Chapada da Contagem and vicinity

The subsp. urbica apparently replaces subsp.
setosa over much of the Paranoa basin in the
Federal District. It may be recognized by very
long floral bracts, by the lack (complete or almost
so) of glandular trichomes or viscidity, and by
the pinnae on the average longer and composed
of Jarger, more distant leaflets. The subspecies

of Dawson 14780 (NY) are thinly stiffly setose
and sparsely glandular-setulose; those of Jrwin
33045 (NY) are densely softly villosulous and
glandular-setulose but unarmed and almost
without plain setae. In preliminary studies I re-
ferred the material to two species, for 1 had not
yet accepted, in defiance of long tradition, the
assimilation into one species of armed M. pai-
udosa and unarmed MM. setosa. I now interpret
these superficially different forms found concen-
trated on the heights of Chapada dos Veadeiros

Mimosa melanecarpa closely resembles M. se-
tosa, from which it is most easily and reliably
distinguished by the externally setose calyx. The
leaflets are mostly smaller and more crowded,
and the pod more pronouncedly stipitate, break-
ing up into proportionately longer articles. All
flowering collections of 44. melanocarpa known
to me were made in the dry autumn and early
winter months of May to July, whereas almost
all collections of flowering M. setosa are dated
between late September and March. This asyn-
chrony in flowering may preserve the identity of
the species where they are sympatric.

Mimosa caliciadenia may be a local derivative
of widespread Af. setosa subsp. paludosa, which
it resembles in viscid and prickly vesture and in
small heads of flowers glabrous except for a few
mninute setulae on rim of calyx. It differs, how-
ever, in relatively few distant pinnae and fewer
leaflets (as recounted in the foregoing diagnosis),
and in the shorter, but not narrower, therefore
proportionately broader, few-seeded, thinly setu-
lose and not viscid-villosulous pod. Mimosa ad-
enocarpa has similar leaf-formula, but smaller
leaftets, gland-tipped corollas subtended by mi-
nute bracts, pods less than halfas wide, and much
smnaller seeds. The epithet caliciadenia refers to
the relatively large stalked cupshaped glands that
suggest the stalked mazedium of the lichen Cal-
icium.
It is appropriate to mention here specimens in
bud (Jrwin 28567. NY) from near S. Jodo da
Chapada north of Diamantina, which have the
unusually stout capitate-glandular setae of M.
caliciadenia combined with the leaf-formula of
M. setosa subsp. patudosa, but capitula densely
golden-setose prior to anthesis. I have referred
them provisionally to Af. setosa subsp. paludosa
sensu lato, but I suspect that they represent a
distinct taxon.

Mimosa acroconica is clearly related to M. ca-
liciadenia, of which it has the armament of scat-
tered aculei and the pin-shaped setae concave
and resiniferous at tip, but differs in two striking
particulars: truly sessile leaves; and extraordi-
nary dilated stipules, the papery sheath of which
falts precoctously from a lunate scar. The similar
bractlike stipules that subtend nascent capitula
are imbricate at the tip of inflorescence branch-
lets into a loose cone of scales much like that
seen in some species of Desrtodivm, but unex-
pected in Mimosa. It is to this feature that the
epithet alludes.

by Bentham for Af, setosa. From this Af. aecedens
differs in simple, notably long-setose stems that
die back annually to the rootstock, in propor-
tionately long narrow leaves lacking interpinnal
spicules, in the mostly lateral and axillary, not
pseudoracemose peduncles, and further, from
sympatric var. sefosa, in the glabrous or only
minutely ciliolate calyx, It was recognized as dis-
tinct, but never formally described, by Harms
from a collection made by Glaziou in early 1895
in the present Federal District. Harms’s epithet
affinis being preoccupied in Mimosa, 1 have sub-
stituted accedens, suggested by the apparent af-
finity to M. setosa.

Mimosa aguapeia constitutes a link in the re-
placement series of species endemic to isolated
sandstone tablelands about the sources of the
Paraguay river. It resembles both of the following
species in habit, and M4. orbignyana especially in
the indumentum of fine pin-shaped gland-tipped
setulae on the inflorescence axis and on the fruit,
but is clearly different from both in the many
fewer pinnae and much larger leaflets, as given
in the foregoing key and in the Latin diagnosis.

Bentham annotated the type of Af. orbignyana
as “Mimosa: Ameria Pachycarpae sp. but
left it undescribed. Like 44. riedelii, its analogue
on the sandstone caprock of Chapada dos Gui-
Maries in Mato Grosso, M. orbignyana has the
ample multifoliclate leaves and general aspect of
ser. Pachycarpae, but the pods of both are thin-
textured craspedia with relatively narrow replum
and valves cracking between seeds even before
full maturity, In this feature, and in the panic-
ulate inflorescence and form of calyx, these two
species seem more closely akin to M. al-
though easily set apart by the scaberulous cauline
setae and range of dispersal far distant to the
west. While many common features denote a
close relationship between Af. riedelii and M.
orbignyana, the differences in leaf-formula, in
length of peduncles and in vesture of the pod,
summarized in the diagnosis, are specifically dis-
tinctive.
The floristic relationship between Chapada dos
Guimaraes in Mato Grosso and Sa. de Santiago
in Bolivia, situated respectively on the east and
west periphery of the upper Paraguai basin, is
further exemplified by the two species of Eu-
mimosa, M, dipennatula and M. jacobita. The
chapada and the sierra are remnants of ancient
sandstone caprock perhaps once continuous
across what is now the valley of rio Paraguay.
The possibility of a link beween these isolated
floras on the heights of Sa. do Aguapei, near the
Brazil-Bolivia border at 16°S, cries for investi-
gation.

forwardly subappressed setae, rarely also viscid-
villosulous, when ripe separating entire from rep-

The foregoing description records the limits of
variation observed in the swarm of closely re-
lated microspecies that I here evaluate as vari-
eties of a polymorphic M. foliolesa. Their col-
lective range extends over much of the Brazilian
Planalto where they form a network of vicariant
forms, each often sympatric with a variety of 1.
aibolanata, or of M. claussenii, or of both. These
three complexes are built up by accretion about
three distinct general types, but I have found no
one infallible criterion by which every member
ofeach can be referred to its group. Each criterion
that is useful in one context fails in another, so
that it could be argued that the three complexes
run together in a continuous fabric of variation.
Field observation and experimental work is
needed to determine whether or not this is the
case, but to combine all three complexes under
one specific heading would defeat the aims of
classification, for it would assign to one megaspe-
cies plants radically dissimilar in appearance, in
detail, and in geographic dispersal.
Ideally, A4. foliolosa sensu lato has a distinctly
shrubby growth-form, relatively narrow stipules,
an extended foliate stem-axis below the pseu-
doraceme yet raised (in mature individuals) on
a framework of defoliate older branches, rela-
tively short pinnae and small leaflets, and rela-
tively small, shortly pedunculate capitula. By
contrast, 44. afbolanaia sensu lato has a virgate
growth-form with leaves at anthesis mostly
crowded below mid-stem (but the inflorescence
often hysteranthously foliate), the leaves them-
selves ampler, and the plumper capitula com-
posed of longer flowers, but not different in length
of peduncles. Mimosa claussenii varies in habit
between the growth-forms just described, but has
broad stipules and either very ample leaves con-
sisting of long pinnae and long leaflets, or large
capitula bore on long peduncles, or some com-
bination of these characters, Departures from the
idealized state of each character are frequent, as
will be evident from the serial and infraspecific
keys. In assigning a particular plant to one of
these three complexes I have been obliged to
make arbitrary decisions which are obviously
open to dispute or correction.

branchlets to which the epithet densa was orig-
inally applied. I refer var. corpulenta to M. fo-
liolosa subsp. foliolosa because of its propor-
tionately long leaf-rachis and short but numerous
pinnae bearing about twenty pairs of leaflets less
than 3 mm long. These leaves, however, are com-
bined with an extremely massive pod not en-
countered elsewhere in subsp. foliolosa. The pod
of subsp. pachycarpa var. gravida approaches that
of var, corpulenta in girth and width of replum,
but is about twice as long and coupled with much
longer pinnae and larger leaflets. The only other
mimosa of the pachycarpous type known to oc-
cur south of rio Paranaiba in western Minas Ge-
rais is Af. lithoreas, near Patrocinio, obviously
different in humifuse inflorescence and long pe-

This troublesome plant formed part of A.
multipinna Benth., herein typified in the sense
of the closely related mimosa endemic to Sa.
Dourada that differs in more numerous, more
crowded and smaller, veinless leaflets and in larg-
er capitula. In leaflets and capitula var. cerca-
doénsis is essentially like sympatric var. foedera-
dis, of which it perhaps represents an exceptionally
vigorous, multipinnate population.

Benth., and the variety was also encountered by
Glaziou in 1895, it has never acquired a name
of its own. Its range very nearly coincides with
that of subsp. foliolosa var. pubescens, with which
it is sometimes associated, but it is readily dis-
tinguished by fewer longer pinnae and longer,
dorsally nerved, facially glabrous feaflets.

I employ the epithet pachycarpa in this con-
nection with some uneasiness. The type survives
only in photograph, the type-locality is not cer-
tainly known, and the unicate specimen from
which Bentham described the species consisted
ofan over-mature fruiting branchlet from which
the lower leaves, probably more ample and com-
plex than those that remain, have fallen, Ben-
tham recorded no exact locality for Mf. pachy-
carpa, but the words Vailo fundo written in ink
next to Sello’s printed label (F Neg. 1397!) may
plausibly be equated with the place of that name
in Sa. do Espinhago of central Minas Gerais,

The var. viscidula closely resembles var.
pachycarpa, vicariant southward along the Serra
at similar clevations, but differs in pronounced
viscid indumentum of stems and foliage, in larg-

Bentham described M. vernicosa from a frag-
mentary specimen sent from St, Petersburg by
Langsdorff, which shows only simplified upper
leaves with some 4-6 pairs of pinnae. He asso-
ciated it with Af. nitens, which has similar leaf-
formula, but Riedel’s full collection, numbered
1093 at LE and so distributed subsequently to
herbaria in United States, bears ample cauline
leaves, flowers in excellent condition and ripe
fruits, demonstrating a much closer affinity to 4.
foliolosa subsp, pachycarpa. From var. pachy-
carpa, which replaces it immediately south of Sa.
da Lapa on Sa, do Cipé and vicinity, var. ver-
nicosa differs in thicker capitula and larger gla-
brous that often turn livid-black when
dry. The capitula are almost those of var. viscidu-
fa, vicariant immediately northward along the
crest of Sa. do Espinhago, but var. vernicosa is
only remotely and obscurely stipitate-glandular.
These three varieties are interpreted as links in
areplacement series within the widespread subsp.
Ppachycarpa.
In Flora Bentham cited M. verni-
cosa not only from Minas Gerais but also from
Borba on the lower Madeira river, said to be in
the state of Para though actually in Amazonas.
This record is based on Riedel 629 (LE!, mounted
with Riedel 12), which appears to me to be most
probably part of the type-collection from Sa. da
Lapa, accidentally mislabelted and renumbered
although still directly associated with the type-
set. The occurrence of any mimosa of this type
in the Hylaean forest is wholly implausible.

The isolated populations that I refer to var,
peregrina seem to represent an offshoot of the
M. foliolosa complex, even though detached
branches that do not reveal the woody frame-
work of former seasons closely mimic M. albo-
fanata var. brasiliana. Within M. foliolosa the
variety is subordinated to subsp. pachycarpa be-
cause the floral bracts and their setae are until
just before anthesis forwardly imbricated over
the flowerbuds. Within the subspecies it is hand-
ily distinguished by densely uniformly yellowish-
hispid, not scabrous-strigose pods. The var. vis-
cida, found in similar environment on Sa. do
Espinhago in Minas Gerais, differs further in
slightly wider leaflets and in abundantly viscid-
setulose foliage, Without flowers var. peregrina
resembles transfranciscan varieties of subsp.
brevibractea, but the pod of each is perceptibly
different: that of var. brevibractea appressed-sca-
brous; that of var. paranani scabrous-hispid on
the broader replum but bearing a silky fleece of
long-attenuate setae on the valves.
The known collections of var. peregrina differ
somewhat in pubescence, even though all come
from within 18 km radius of Rio das Contas.
The fruiting type and Harley 19784 (NY) in flow-
er, from the lower slopes of Pico de Almas, have
stems and inflorescence shaggy with tapering se-
tae to 2-3.5 mm long; in Harley 20138 (NY)
from south of Rio das Contas the setae do not
exceed 1.5 mm in length.

Inthe Federal District var. brevibractea is sym-
Patric with subsp. foliolosa var. pubescens and
with subsp, pachycarpa var. foederalis, but differs
from both in moriform capitula, from the first
in much longer pinnae and larger leaflets, and
from the second in more numerous and conse-
quently more crowded leaflets. The closely re-
lated var. paranani, next following, is vicariant
northward, outside the District, and differs sub-
stantially only in vesture of the somewhat broad-
er pods.
The var. brevibractea was collected first by
Glaziou in 1895 and recognized, but not de-
scribed by Harms as a new species. I here adopt
Harms’s epithet, but in the subspecific and va-

silky-flagelliform setae of the peduncles and es-
pecially in the pod of broad outline, shaggy on
the valves with long silky setae and girdled with
an exceptionally broad, more shortly scabrous-
setose replum, As Harms’s epithet muftipin-

recalls subsp. foliolesa var. multipinna of Sa.
Dourada. This differs in leaf-formula (pinnae
more and leaflets less numerous in comparable
leaves), in conclike capitula, and in scabrous pods

This perplexing plant has the broad coriaceous
stipules and coarse setose pubescence of MM.
claussenii var. prorsiseta but the moriform ca-
pitula, relatively short corolla, and narrow sub-
appressed-setose pod of foliolosa sensu lato;
possibly it is derived from hybridization between
forms of these two closely related species. I pro-
visionally subordinate it to subsp. brevibractea,
in the belief that field-study is required to de-
termine its true status.

Resembling Af. foliolosa var. foederatis in ap-
pressed setose pubescence and number of pinnae,
but leaflets of longer pinnae more numerous, ca-
pitula moriform prior to anthesis, and pod dense-
ly setose overall, not merely strigose; If-formula

ly spiculate between pinna-pairs, the rachis of
longer pinnae 3.5-5.5 cm, the longer Ifts (4-)5—
7 x 1.2-1.5 mm; peduncles 2-3 cm; capitula
without filaments +9 mm diam.; corolla only
+4 mm.
This plant, which I am unable to refer to any
of the several Pachycarpae found within a few
kilometers radius of Alto Paraiso, was found in
cerrado on a hillside at 1350 m, flowering in
March. It seems to belong to the M. foliolosa
complex, but has random interpinnal spicules on
the leaf-stalk, not seen elsewhere in this group.
The moriform capitula suggest MM. foliolosa var.
paranani, but the pinnae are much fewer, More
material is required to demonstrate its affinity
and status.

Mimosa pachycarpoides is known to me from
the friting type, collected in May, 1903, from a
sterile topotype collected by Malme in October
of the same year, and from one modern specimen
(Mori 16807, NY), at the same stage of maturity
as the type and virtually replicating it. These
plants are plainly related to Mf. foliolosa sensu
lato, and in particular to M. foliolosa var. gravi-
da, which has a similarly large fruit girdled by a
massive replum. The species appears to differ
from var. gravida in lack of puberulence and
gland-tipped setulae, in shorter, fewer-foliolate
pinnae, in wholly glabrous (or only residually
ciliolate) leaflets, and in the basally spurred setae
of stem and leaf-stalks, A full comparison must
be deferred until flowers are obtained, when an
evaluation of taxonomic rank will become ap-
propriate,

I describe 4. auriberbis with trepidation, being
ignorant of the fruit, and in perplexity about its
genuine affinities in ser. Pachycarpae, but as t
am unable to refer the type to any known species,
I presume to call it to the attention of botanists
in the Federal District, in the hope that more
can be learned about its morphology and dis-
persal. In some respects it recalls the micro-
phyllidious forms of M. claussenii, but has leaves
scarcely half as long. In detail of the flower, it
seems close to sympatric M. rava, which see for
comment on differences, In the diagnosis I have
compared it with Af. setosissima, superficially
similar in leaves crowded at the end of the
branches and in number and size of pimnae and
leaflets; but Af. auriberbis is, so far as known, a
much smaller shrub with bark not exfoliating
from year-old branches.
The type-collection of 44. auriberbis had been
distributed to the herbaria listed above before I
commenced my study of the genus. The isotypes

Mimosa rava and M, auriberbis, which were
collected together and are known only from this
one place, seem closely related, but are so dif-
ferent in leaf-formula (as given in diagnosis), as
well as in quality of leaf-pubescence, form of
stipules and size of capitula, that it seems im-
possible to conceive of them as conspecific. The
plants bear a strong resemblance in habit te the
more paucipinnate forms of M. foliolosa var. foe-
deralis, but the leaflets are much more numerous,
more crowded, and densely villosulous on both
faces. Nevertheless, when better known, Sf. rava
may emerge as no more than an extreme satellite
of the M, foliolosa complex. Pentamerous flow-
ers in this species seem to occur only at random
among more normal tetramerous ones.

A modem collection of M. feiocephala from

Bentham correctly foretold the nature of the pod,
which closely resembles that of Af. foliolosa sensu

wlates Mf. fotiolosa var. foederatis, and can only
be extracted from the orbit of M4. foliolosa by
virtue of the dorsally glabrous floral bracts and
the perfectly glabrous The significance
of this precarious difference, which up to the

need reappraisal as more is leamed about the

Mimosa nitens has the efoliate paniculate in-
florescence of AM. setosa sensu lato or Af, melano-
carpa, but differs at anthesis by relatively few
pairs of pinnae, and in fruit by valvate dehiscence
of the pod. As often happens in Mimosa, a re-
duced number of pinnae is compensated by
greater length, the whole leaf-formula being char-
acteristic in high degree. The type-collection has
simply setose, otherwise hairless stems, but one

both exactly typical individuals and others with

Mimosa humivagans and sibling M. prorepens
have been collected close together, but in spite
of resemblances in habit and vesture I cannot
construe them as other than distinct species, so
different are the numbers of pinnae and the pro-
portions of calyx to corolla, as described in the
foregoing diagnosis. The ripe pod of neither is
yet known, so that their affinities within sect.
Pachycarpae remain open to revision. In many
Tespects they resemble aspects of the polymor-
phic M. foliolosa, but differ collectively in pli-
antly humifuse stems arising anew each year from
a woody rootstock. In this growth-habit and fur-
ther in subsessile leaves A4. humivagans recalls
M. (Pauctfoliatae) pratincola, but differs from it
(inter alia) by hispidly setose (not simply puber-
ulent) stems and leaf-stalks, absence of para-
phyllidia, teaf-formula attaining vii-xii/10-15

Mimosa prorepens is one of three planaltine
Pachycarpae with procumbently humifuse her-
baceous stems arising annually from woody roots,
and in one or other focus of its apparently bi-
centric range it is sympatric with each of the other
two. The fruits of none of these three mimosas
are completely known, and it is possible, but I
think unlikely, that they are less closely related
than I have assumed from common habit of
growth and from similarities in stipule, foliage,
flower, and at least shortly monadelphous fita-
ments. The differential characters of these ha-
bitally similar species, 47. humivagans sympatric
on the sources of rio Parana north of the Federal
District and M. pseudofoliofosa potentially sc on
the upper Corumb4 south of the District, are
mentioned at length under the protologues of
these species. Outside the humifuse group I find
suggestive similarities between M. prorepens and
M. accedens, especially in aspect and relatively
thin texture of the nearly mature pod. The latter
differs decisively, however, in virgately erect
stems and glabrous corolla-lobes.

Mimosa adenotricha has precisely the aspect
of M. foliolosa subsp. pachycarpa, except for the
armament of acroscopically curved prickles. The
species is maintained at the taxonomic level at
which it was described, but I question whether
it is anything more substantial than a local ex-
pression of M. foliolosa sensu lato. A small vari-
ation in leaf-formula exists between specimens,
perhaps between populations, of adenotricha,
but numbers of pinna- and leaflet-pairs are not
associated with any other known differential fea-
ture, nor are they geographically segregated. Con-
sequently I regard M. heterotricha, of which rel-
atively high leaf-formula was the only diagnostic
mark, as a minor variant. Burkart’s (1974) ele-
gant figure of Af. heterotricha is a true likeness
of the majority of known collections of Mf. ad-
enotricha.

prostrate suffrutex that does not, like most forms
of M. claussenii and M. foliolosa, acquire erect
or ascending defoliate trunks, but dies back an-
nually to the tevel of the ground. At anthesis the
erect wandlike or stiffly assurgent, simple or few-
branched fertile stem may be devoid of expanded
leaves exept at a few subradical nodes or may
bear mature foliage upward to mid-stem, How-
ever, the capitula at anthesis are commonly sub-
tended by a hysteranthously expanding leaf that
appears at that time only in primordial form but
grows out rapidly thereafter and greatly surpasses
the mature fruiting peduncle. In consequence
there are marked differences between plants of
one sort collected in flower and in fruit. Inde-
pendently of seasonal dimorphism the mutually
remote major populations of M. albolanata differ
in size and propinquity of leaflets, in tength of
peduncles, in absolute and proportionate lengths
of floral bracts and flowers (and hence in di-
ameter of capitula), in depth of calycine cup and
in length of its cilia, and in pubescence of the
pods, these as yet incompletely known. None of
the observed differences is truly constant even
within the boundary of a particular locality, and
I can discern in the group only an inchoate stage
of differentiation. The key to geographic varieties
that follows is imperfectly realized for it fails
effectively to distinguish all of them at every stage
of maturity.

inflorescence-axes to 2.5-5(-6) mm, the young
inflorescence shaggy-silky; pinnae of larger lvs
22-32-jug; longer pinnae 3.5—-5 cm, their lfts 30—
44-jug. and to x (0.6-)0,8-1.2 mm, all
glabrous facially but ciliolate; capitula without
filaments (12-)13-15 mm diam., the bracts 3-6

densely hispid with erect-incurved brownish-yel-
low tapering setae to 1.5—2.5(-4) mm long and
at base to 0.2-0.4 mm diam.
In cerrado climax and in intermittently burned
campo, 950-1250 m, locally plentiful in Distrito
Federal, Brazil and in upper Corumba valley im-
mediately to the w.; disjunct on Sa. de Cabral in
centr. Minas Gerais.—F. IX-IIi(-V), the pods
maturing slowly and long persisting.
This, Af. ciaussenii and M. foliolosa are the
three Pachycarpae most abundant in the Federal
District, Although collected repeatedly on the
University campus and in relict cerrado within
Brasilia city, it has never been satisfactorily
named. In several respects it is intermediate be-
tween the other two, having longer pinnae and
plumper capitula than Mf. foliolosa but smaller
leaflets and shorter peduncles than claussenii.
The flagelliform tip of setae that cloak the young
inflorescence in a silky fleece is commonly lost
in age, so that the fruiting stem appears more
shortly and coarsely hispid. The disjunct popu-
lation on Serra do Cabral is known from only
one collection (Duarte 7730, NY) in mature fruit
and may possibly represent a taxonomically dis-
tinct form of M. albolanata.

This is weakly distinguished morphologically
from var. brasifiana, but in its disjunct habitat
seems to be uniformly so. The earliest collec-
tions, made by Burchell in 1828, were referred
by Bentham partly (no. 6848, K) to Mf. claussenti
and partly (nos. 6681, 6700-15, K) to M. gard-
neri, and have contributed to confused notions
of the real identity of ali these species.

forwardly appressed or narrowly incurved-as-
cending setae to 0.7-2.5 mm, these separated by
spaces greater than the diameter of their dilated
base, hence not concealing the fuscous-brown face
of valves.

Somewhat fewer, more distant and generally
longer leafiets and commonly thinner, shorter,
less silky setose indumentum of the inflorescence
together weakly distinguish flowering var. pau-
cipinna from var. brasiliana; but the dark brown,
more thinly and shortly scabrous-hispidulous
pods (not yet confirmed in distantly disjunct pop-
ulations in Minas Gerais) are characteristic.
The earliest collections of var, paucipinna, Pohi
4.1469 (K, NY, W), from unknown locality were
mistaken by Bentham, who had no means of
knowing the great differences in stature, for A.
gardneri. Pohl’s specimens consist of the her-
baceous part of sessile subshrubs, that is of whole
plants short of the woody terrestrial trunk or the
buried xylopodium, and only fortuitously resem-
ble terminal branchlets of arborescent Mf. gard-
neri. They closely resemble modern collections
of the population, now well sampled, found on
Sa. dos Cristais within ten or fifteen kilometers
of Cristalina, and they may well have been ob-
tained there. The status of the two known pop-
ulations in Minas Gerais, which appear nearly
identical with those of Goias when in flower, may
require reassessment when the pod is secured.

The sibling species Af. erforrhachis and M.
cryptothamnos represent collectively the culmi-
nation in a series of increasingly specialized cam-
po life-forms leading from the distinctly shrubby
habit of M4. claussenii, with leaves scattered along
the stems of the season, through the relatively
undifferentiated Mf. aibolanata, with leafy stems
going out into a virgate pseudoraceme efoliate at
anthesis (but leafy afterward), to an erect, per-
manently efoliate wand rising from a rosette of
very large radical or subradical leaves. Closely
similar in habit, M. eriorrhachis and M. cryp-
tothamnos differ in several correlated characters,
as given in the foregoing diagnosis and repeated
in discussion of the neat. The small vicariant
ranges of the two species coincide neatly with
those of Chamaecrista conferta vars. simulans
and machrisiana (cf. Irwin & Barmeby, Mem.

Mimosa cryptothamnos is closely related to Mf.
eriorrhachis, vicariant immediately southward
on Sa. Geral do Parana, but is distinguished by
stout woody humifuse trunks, longer true peti-
oles, slightly longer and wider leaflets, smaller,
long-pedunculate capitula, and especially by small
floral bracts, greatly surpassed by the associated
flower, In Af. eriorrhachis each bract is as long
as its flower and covers it in bud, so that the
capitulum prior to anthesis is conelike, not mori-
form as in M. cryptothamnos. The very long and
dense comose indumentum of M. eriorrhachis is
visually arresting but basically of the same type
as in M. cryptothamnos, a little exaggerated in
length and density.

The var. soderstromii has the capitula and pods
of var. claussenii but is distinguished by peculiar
growth-form described above, a partly glandular
indumentum, and a modified rhythm of growth.
At anthesis, which occurs in July and August, a
few very large mature subradical leaves, appar-
ently of the previous year’s growth, persist at tip
of some annotinous branches, while from the tip
of others arise short stout leafless axes bearing a
succession of long-pedunculate and relatively
large capitula. Subsequently this flowering axis
bears beyond the flowers a tuft of hysteranthous
leaves of which I have seen no example fully
grown out. The growth-cycle deserves careful ob-
servation in the field.
I dedicate this odd but handsome mimosa to
the late Dr. Thomas Soderstrom, agrostologist
at the Smithsonian Institution, who accompa-
nied Dr. Irwin in 1964.

Mimosa gardneri is inconveniently interme-
diate between Af. claussenii sensu lato and M.
albolanata sensu lato, having the stature, the very
long leaves and the relatively long leaflets of the
former but the extended pseudoraceme and short
individual peduncles of the latter, The type-spec-
imens, cut off at base of the simple or branched
pseudoraceme, were taken, according to Gard-
ner’s label at Kew, from a small tree, a stature
never attained or even approached, so far as
known, by 44. albelanata. Serra da Natividade
lies far to the north of any known population of
M. albolanata, but much nearer to the also ar-
borescent M. claussenii var. corneiseta at about
14°S on Chapada dos Veadeiros. Until the stature
of true M. gardneri can be confirmed and the pod
made known, no evaluation of its relationships
is possible. Iam obliged to accept it provisionally
as a distinct species.
Bentham’s concept of M4. gardneri was based
from the first on a mixture of the arborescent
lectotype and suffruticose Mf. afbolanata repre-
sented by Pohi d. 1469. His extended description
in Flora brasiliensis introduced further elements
of M. albolanata, of which he particularly noted
the softer, more pliant setae. The epithet gardneri
has since been applied in herbaria to a variety
of large-leaved Pachycarpae and the true plant
of Gardner has dropped out of sight,
The type-number Gardner 3136 was recorded
by error in the protologue as 2/36, a mistake
corrected in Flora brasiliensis,

Mimosa stylosais closely akin to M. claussenii,
resembling its var. prorsiseta in habit and vesture
and its var, corneiseta in leaf-formula and ves-
ture but less so in habit. It differs from M. claus-
senii sensu lato in shorter peduncles and vesture
of the pod, of which the livid exocarp is visible
between relatively short setae and not concealed
by a long dense fleece. Related species known to
occur in Sa, do Espinhago either have much
shorter leaf-stalks, shorter pinnae, or both (A/.
foliolosa vars.) or, if the leaves are similar in size
and formula (M. a/bolanata var.) they are borne
on abbreviated stems arising from a subsessile
terrestrial woody pediment. None of these shares
with M. stylosa the elongated style which projects
6-9 mm beyond the longer set of filaments. The
material from Sa. do Cipé (Joly & al. 1748, E)
differs from that from near Diamantina in subob-
solete true petioles, somewhat shorter pinnae,
and more fugacious stipules, but otherwise agrees
well with the type. Mimosa foliolosa var. pachy-
carpa, the mimosa of this series common and

This elegant but troublesome mimosa appears
very closely related to M. claussenti var. micro-
phyllidia, with which it shares slender arbores-
cent stature and extended, hysteranthously foli-
ate inflorescence; but its extremely short pinnae
and tiny leaflets are more suggestive of M. foli-
olosa sensu lato. If referred either to M, claussenii
or to Af. fotiolosa, it breaks down the already
fragile distinction between these two already un-
wieldy complexes. Although I suspect that M.
rheiptera represents an extreme microphyllidi-
ous expression of the A4. claussenii line, I de-
scribe it as an independent species for taxonomic
convenience. If the pod turns out to be that of
M. claussenii, the status of M. rheiptera will need
reassessment,
In general habit of growth M. rheiptera resem-
bles M4. struthionoptera, but the latter stands well
apart, nevertheless, in dense velvety-villosulous
indumentum, longer narrower stipules, and few-
er pinnae accommodating to 45-50 (not +30)
pairs of leaflets, The wholly eglandular Af. densa
differs yet further in having leaves and compact
inflorescence crowded at tip of decorticate
branches and in smaller flowers with filaments
hardly half as long,

tum of the foliage, extended (not rosette-form-

it closely resembles M. rhetptera, which differs
in predominantly yellow-setose pubescence and
longer peduncles, Field observation of growth-

Mimosa setosissima stands as prototype of a
replacement series of closely related forms iso-
lated on remnants of arenitic caprock of the To-
cantins—Paranaiba divide in southern Goias: M4.
setosissima itself on Sa. dos Pireneus, M4. herin-
geri on the sources of rio Corumba in Distrito
Federal, and Af. decorticans on Sa. dos Cristais.
To these should be added M. laniceps and M.
densa of Chapada dos Veadeiros, the former dis-
tinguished by woolly indumentum and the latter
by exceptionally short pinnae. The diagnostic
features of the group are tall-shrubby or arbo-
rescent life-form and the early deciduous epi-
dermis which exposes a characteristic cinnamon-
brown underbark on branchlets of the second
year. Mimosa setosissima most closely resembles
M, decorticans in number and length of pinnae
and leaflets, but has long-setose leaf-stalks, gla-
brous calyx, and relatively short
pods (2.5-3.5, not 4.5-6 cm long). Afimosa he-
ringert, the small range of which lies between
those of the two last, has on average fewer and
longer pinnae than either (with consequently less
crowded leaflets), the ciliolate calyx and long pod
of M. decorticans, but the long peduncles of M.
setosissima. The taxonomic status of these ob-
viously close kindred is debatable, but I have
concluded that, on account of their spatial iso-
lation and the impossibility of interbreeding, they
may conveniently be classed as species.

4: 405. 1842.—Typus infra sub var. densa in-
dicatur.
Round-headed arborescent shrubs attaining 2-
4m, the trunk to 12 cm diam., the lvs and short
immersed panicle of relatively small, squatly
ovoid or globose capitula crowded together on
an axis +1-1.5 dm, the epidermis of branchlets
promptly exfoliating with fall of Ivs, the anno-
tinous and older stems reddish-brown, the axes
of lvs and inflorescences densely strigose or silky-
villous with forwardly incurved or subappressed,
distally short-attenuate or long-flagelliform setae
to + 1,5-3 mm, the lfts glabrous above or on both
faces, ciliolate. Stipules deltate- or lance-acu-
minate 2.5-6 x 1-3.5 mm, the firm caducous
blades chocolate-brown and glabrous within.
Leaf-staiks cm, the first pair of pinnae
not over 5 mm distant from hard obese pulvinus,
the longer interpinnal segments (2-)2.5-6.5 mm,
the ventral groove continuous (spicules 0); pin-
nae 10-32(-42)-jug., strongly decrescent proxi-
mally and a little so distally, the rachis of longer
ones 16-25 mm, the longer interfoliolar seg-
ments 0.5—0.7 mm; Ifts of longer pinnae 24-36-
jug., the first pair next to pulvinus (paraphyllidia
0), the blades narrowly oblong obtuse, the largest
(1.5-)2-4 x 0.5-0.8 mm, the blades obscurely
venulose dorsally. Peduncies 2-5 cm; capitula
without filaments 8-10 mm diam., conelike when
young and densely sericeous, moriform just prior
to anthesis; bracts elliptic-oblanceolate or spat-
ulate 1.8-3 mm, densely setulose dorsally; flow-
ers 4-merous 8-androus, all but the lowest bi-
sexual; calyx pappiform, the externally glabrous
tube 0.4-0.5 mm, the fringe of cilia + 1-1.3 mm;
corolla narrowly turbinate or funnelform (3—)3.3—
3.8 mm, the tube glabrous, the ovate concave
lobes 0.7-1.2 mm, densely setulose dorsally; fil-
aments pink, monadelphous through mm
around base of ovary, exserted 6-9.5 mm. Pads
(of var. densa, otherwise unknown) 2-4 per ca-
pitulum, erect subsessile, in profile narrowly ob-
long or oblong-oblanceclate 30-55 x 10-12mm,
broadly cuneate at base, abruptly contracted dis-
tally into a stout erect cusp 2-4 mm, 5--9-seeded,
the straight replum 1.5-2 mm wide, the low-
convex valves +0.2 mm thick in section (exo-
and endocarp of subequal thickness), the replum
and valves alike densely subappressed-setose
overall, the ripe valves separating entire from
replum but commonly remaining attached at very
base; seeds not seen.
Among several superficially similar micro-
phyllidious Pachycarpae of highland Goids M.
densa is known by the coincidence of exfoliating
epidermis of annotinous branches, relatively short
crowded spreading leaves, and immersed panicle
of relatively small capitula. The framework of
naked cinnamon-brown older branches bearing
aloft tufts of foliage recalls M. setosissima and
M. laniceps, but these differ collectively in larger
capitula composed of longer flowers with further
exserted filaments. Allopatric Af. setosissima dif-
fers further in glabrous (not densely ciliate, hence
pappiform) calyx, and sympatric M. in
silky-tomentose vesture of extremely fine flagel-
liform setae, and perhaps also in a broader pod
(as far as known 11-15, not 10-12 mm wide).
The also sympatric Af. struthionoptera has not
only much larger flowers and longer filaments
but elongate leafy hornotinous branches, and
characteristically erect, not spreading subrosu-
late leaves. Mimosa densa consists of two vicar-
iant varieties:

Mimosa pycnocoma, described by Bentham in
his first paper on Brazilian Mimosa, was referred
without comment in his summary monographs
(1875, 1876) to the synonymy of AM. claussenii.
Its close relationship lies, I believe, in the direc-
tion not of Af. claussenii but of the arborescent
group clustering around Af. setosissima of Sa. dos
Pireneus, M4. decorticans of Sa. dos Cristais, and
M. densa and M. laniceps of Chapada dos Vea-
deiros, with all of which it shares the striking
feature of exfoliating epidermis of year-old stems
and, inferentially, a framework of cinnamon-
brown branches. It differs from MM. setosissima
in the longer finer setae of stems and young leaf-
let-margins, in absence of glandular setulae, in
larger and fewer leaflets, in smaller capitula com-
posed of flowers shorter by one-third, and in much
shorter, densely ciliate calyx. Afimosa densa and
M. laniceps differ collectively from Af. pycno-
coma in abbreviated pinnae attaining at most
16-30 (not 40-50) mm in length, and M. fani-
ceps, which is geographically the nearer, further
in silky-tomentose vesture and substantially lon-
ger flowers.

Mimosa oligosperma seems closely related to
M. densa and its relatives, all of which could be
envisaged as detached vicariant offshoots of one
comprehensive species-complex. It differs from
all these in a very smal] few-seeded pod, and
from M. densa, a near neighbor on the southern
spurs of Chapada dos Veadeiros and Chapada
do Parana, in somewhat longer pinnae and slight-
ly larger leaflets and flowers. The only modern
collection of M. oligosperma known to me (Ma-
cedo 3633, NY) is described by the collector as
arbusto espathado da serra, all that we know at
present of the plant’s habit or stature.
The type and paratype of M. oligesperma were
referred by Bentham to a broadly conceived and
highly polymorphic . claussentii.

Mimosa rhodostegia resembles M. regina in
enlarged connate stipules, a character unique to
these sibling species of ser. Pachycarpae. I am
apprehensive about describing from single col-
lections two species so clearly related, for new
samples may very well devaluate some charac-
ters that at present appear sharply diagnostic.
The differences in pubescence may prove illu-
sory, but the stature of the plants, the differing
texture and venation of the stipules, and different
size of capitula and flowers cannot be passed
over. It is noteworthy that Af. rhodostegia and
M. regina were collected in like stages of early
anthesis at different seasons of the year, the for-
mer in late Sepember, at the beginning of the wet
season, the latter in late March, at the outset of
the dry season. They may be differentiated in
their life-cycles as are M. melanocarpa and sym-
patric forms of M. setosa. Further observation
of these strangely modified mimosas is required.

A spectacular mimosa, notable for its pachy-
caul habit, very large but early deciduous bracts
and stipules of firm texture, dorsally setose and
glabrous within. It resembles M. rhodostegia in.
amplitude of bracts, but in growth-form and in
coarse setose indumentum it seems closer to the
nearly sympatric M. manidea. From this it differs
strikingly in the internally glabrous and decid-
uous bracts and stipules, more numerous leaflets
per pinna, and longer flowers.

Mimosa manidea is one of a sympatric pair of
arborescent mimosas endemic to the heights of
Chapada dos Veadeiros, spectacular colonial
species notable for pachycaul trunk and cande-
labriform branches bearing leaves and capitula
clustered at tip of the current year's growth. The
differences between the pair are discussed further
under M. oedociada. The epithet manidea refers
to the coarse overlapping armature of scalelike
stipules that clothe the year-old leafless stems,
scales that suggest those of the pangolin (Manis
pentadactyla).

Mimosa capito differs from the several com-
patriot pachycaul arborescent species in the dense
inflorescence of shortly pedunculate capitula
nestling in the terminal rosettes of ample leaves
and in the completely hairless corollas. It has
larger leaves than either M. oedoclada or M.
manidea and differs from the first of these in non-
exfoliating bark of annotinous branchlets and
from the second by ear!y deciduous stipules. Its
close neighbors M. densa and M. laniceps have
exfoliating bark combined with smaller leaves,
fewer leaflets, shorter peduncles, smaller flowers,
or some of these characters combined. The fo-
liage is completely eglandular, but there are a few
capitate excretory setulae hidden among the lon-
ger plane setae of the floral bracts. In this respect
the species recalls 4. claussenii, in practice easily
distinguished by an extended inflorescence and
setulose corolla-lobes.

Among the several potentially arborescent
Pachycarpae of candelabriform habit native to
Chapada dos Veadeiros M, cedociada is notable
for exceptionally thick branchlets (mostly 6-12
mm diam., whence the epithet), an indumentum
composed in part of gland-tipped setulae and
consequently clammy foliage, and relatively few
and short pinna-pairs. In many respects it resem-
bles and seems akin to sympatric M. manidea,
but differs substantially in these characters: stip-
ules deciduous with associated leaf, the blade
usually glabrous within and viscid-glandular
without, ordinarily early reflexed; pinnae 8-15
pairs; indumentum of leaf-axes composed of
simple setae to 0.2-0.3 mm diam. at base, fine
villi, and orange gland-tipped setulae; larger leaf-
lets 4—6 x 1.5-2.2 mm. By contrast the stipules
of M. manidea persist a full year after fall of the
associated leaf, the erect blades, setose both with-
in and without, forming an imbricated thatch on
the annotinous branchlets; pinnae of larger leaves
are 18-30 pairs; indumentum of leaf-axes con-
sists of stouter, partly confluent, seemingly
branched setae to 2-6 mm long and 0.4-0.7 mm
in diam. at base mixed with short claviform but
non-excretory setulae; and the larger leaflets are

the inflorescence, which rises at early anthesis
about 3 dm above the older leaves; and from M.

This remarkable mimosa was described in
Glaziou’s Liste as arbuste splendide, haut de 2 a
3 metres, ff blanc rosé. It must be expected to
have the candelabriform habit of related species
such as Mf. manidea and M. regina, The flowering
time indicated in the Liste is a mistake, for Gla-
ziou’s journey to Chapada dos Veadeiros by way
of Formosa was undertaken in January, not in
June, 1905. Despite its arborescent growth form,
M. spiendida appears most closely related to M.
irwimi, which has the same fiery red setose in-
dumentum of the stipules, but is a prostrate shrub
with ellipsoid capitula elevated on scapiform pe-
duncles two to three times as long. Special efforts
should be made to rediscover this truly splendid
mimosa before its probably very limited habitat
is endangered,

Ample radical leaves and scapiform peduncles
arising from a thatch of imbricate stipules clad
in long rufous setae are features common to A.
irwinii and M. speciosissima, and suggest a close
common precursor. As shown in the diagnosis,
they differ in several significant details. The year’s
growth in Af. speciosissima starts anew directly
from the xylopodium, whereas M. irwinii de-
velops humifuse woody trunks bearing the ro-
sette of foliage and peduncles at apex. Compared
with those of Af. speciosissima the leaves of M.
irwinii are more coarsely divided and the leaf-
stalk bears a spicule between each pinna-pair.
While the capitula of MM. speciosissima are glo-
bose, those of M4. irwinii are exceptionally mas-
sive, becoming ellipscid and 2-3 times as long
as their diameter. In another direction M. irwinii
may be related to the pachycaul treelet Af. spien-
dida, which shares the rufous indumentum and
spiculate leaf-stalks that are rare in ser. Pachy-
carpae, This, however, is grossly different in life-
form, and in globose capitula that nestle in the
rosette of leaves on peduncles less than a third
as long.
This unique mimosa is dedicated with affec-
tion to my friend and former colleague Howard
S. Invin, whose immensely rich and judiciousty
selected collection of planaltine mimosae has
contributed much of what is novel in this revi-
sion.

This well marked species is ordinarily recog-
nized at sight by its stemless habit, scapose pe-
duncles, and long red vesture of the imbricate
stipules, characters shared only by the rare M.
irwinti, which differs by spicules between pinna-
pairs and massive ellipsoid capitula. Small
differences can be seen between groups of pop-
ulations of M. speciosissima. On Chapada dos
Yeadeiros and on Chapada da Contagem in Dis-
trito Federal the pinnae are relatively numerous,
in larger leaves commonly 8-16 pairs, and the
plant is strictly stemless. Along streams (Riacho
Fundo; Gama; Cabega de Veado) flowing into
the south arm of Lago do Paranoa in the Federal
District the plants vary from tnuly acaulescent to
shortly acaulescent (peduncles, however, well
surpassing developed stem) and the pinnae are
often fewer. A collection (Rosiu 9, NY, UB) from
Riacho Fundo contains, however, this gamut of
variation: a) at UB, strictly acaulescent, pinnae
to 9-jug,; b) at NY, strictly acaulescent, pinnae
2-3-jug, this closely matching Glazieu 21047

In a region populated by shrubby and arbo-
rescent mimosas of ser. Pachycarpae spectacu-
larly diversified in life-form, M. wie? is itself dis-
tinguished primarily by habit: a tall wandlike
subshrub with few, exceptionally large, either
strictly radical or partly subradical leaves and an
effuse, few-branched panicle rising each season
about 1.5-2 m from the xylopodium. Although
the whole known range of the species spans no
more than about 40 kilometers around the south-
ern foothills of Chapada dos Veadeiros, the ma-
terial presently available falls into two clear-cut
series, different in correlated features of pubes-
cence, leaf-formula, and dimensions of leaflets
and pods, series described below as varieties, The
existence of narrowly vicariant sibling taxa in
this part of the Goids highlands is exemplified
in Mimosa by M. oedoclada—M. manidea and M.
densa var. densa—var. ailligantina of this ac-
count, as well as by Chamaecrista conferta var.
simulans—var. machrisiana (Irwin & Barneby,

Mimosa maguirei is readily distinguished from
other Pachycarpae of Sa. do Espinhago by stat-
ure, smooth livid, ultimately glaucescent stems,
relatively few and distant multifoliolate pinnae,
and virgate efoliate pseudoracemes far exserted
above the leaves. The populations near Dia-
mantina (at Biribiri and west and northwest of
the city) appear to have slightly more numerous
pairs of pinnae than those of Sa. do Cipé, but I
can find no convincing evidence of racial differ-
entiation.
What appears to be historically the first col-
lection of maguire is Giaziou 19727 (Ct Pt

gose with finer tapering, forwardly ascending or
appressed setae to +2 mm, when ripe breaking
into 14-21(-24) or exceptionally only 8-13 (or
by abortion of ovules fewer) free-falling articles,
those near mid-pod 2.54.5 mm long (hence +2—
4 times broader than long), that at each end of
pod longer, all either individually indehiscent,
closed at each end by a septum 0.2-2 mm wide,
or dehiscent and not or only very narrowly mem-
branous-septate, the seeds consequently shed, as
the case may be, either encapsulated (when readi-
ly water-borne) or naked (when instantly sub-
mersible); seeds transverse, narrowly com-
pressed-oblong-ellipsoid +4.5-6 x 2-2.6 mm,
the smooth testa olivaceous or brown-olivaceous
dull.
Mimosa pellita, as described above, is equiv-
alent in essence, though not in all details, to Af.
asperata of Bentham’s revision (1875: 437) and
to M. pigra of most modern floras, but appears
here under an unfamiliar name, Study of the types
of the two Linnaean names that have prevailed
in the literature has shown (Barneby, 1989) that
neither can be applied, sensu stricto, to this com-
menest of all shrubby mimosas, but that each
properly beiongs to a close relative of relatively
narrow range, M, pigra to the species that has
passed in Argentina as M. vellosiella Herter, and
M. asperata to the northern segregate Mf. bertan-
dieri, Only by combining all these into one poly-
morphic taxonomic artifact could 4. pigra, his-
torically the oldest name for any member of the
group, be preserved in the sense of recent au-
thors,
Even when the peripheral microspecies Mf. as-
perata (=M. M. elliptica Benth. and
M. pigra (sens. str.) are isolated, the residue of
Bentham’s “‘Asperatae presents an ini-
tially dismaying array of variation in pubescence,
in armature, in dimensions and form of stipules
and fruits, and in other characters, Analysis re-
veals, however, that ail is not random or chaotic,
but on the contrary subject to order and related
to dispersal. Close attention to attachment of
cauline setae, to form and venation of stipules
and floral bracts, to dehiscence of the fruit and
release of the seeds has revealed unsuspected spe-
cific and varietal entities described herein as M4.
orinocoénsis, M. tarda, and M. pellita vars. de-
hiscens and hispida, the last described at the same
time as M. pellita itself but never correctly char-
acterized. Pruned of these discordant elements,
M. pellita yet remains the most widely dispersed
shrubby mimosa, extending autochthonously in
typical form from tropical lowland Mexico to
northeastern Argentina, over much of Antillea,
over most of tropical Africa, and as a colonist
further afield in Malesia and
Within its immediate group peilita is rec-
ognized by small, firm, dorsally silky-strigose
stipules usually not perceptibly venulose, or if
weakly so, with major nerves five or less in num-
ber. The pod takes two forms. In one the indi-
vidual one-seeded articles fall from the replum
indehisced, sealed at each end by a persistent
septum of variable width; in the other each ar-
ticle dehisces independently into free-falling pan-
els. In the first case each seed is dispersed in a
buoyant envelope and can be borne on water far
from the parent plant; in the second it is shed
naked, to sink directly into mud or water. Pods
of the first type tend to be tumid when ripe and
densely hispid with stiff crowded perpendicular
setae, whereas those of the second type are plano-
compressed and more weakly pilose or strigose
with more scattered, ascending or subappressed
setae, the difference often, but not invariably,
becoming evident before maturation of the fruit.
The dehiscent type, which closely simulates re-
lated .M. tarda, is dispersed in a broad crescent
around the southern periphery of the Amazon
basin, sometimes associated with the indehiscent
type. It is not known to occur in North America
or in the Old World, but it may be cryptically
present, for plants collected in flower only cannot
be distinguished. A variant local in northern
Venezuela notable for narrow ped and small,
proportionately broad seeds may be recognized
as var. hispida.

Mimosa orinocoénsis was collected first in 1886
on the lower Orinoco by Rusby & Squires (77,
197, NY). Their number 17, consisting of a flow-
ering stem and a detached pad, was sent by Brit-
ton to Kew for comparison with allied forms
named by Bentham, N, E. Brown, who made the
comparisons, believed the pod to be extraneous
and pronounced the flowering element an exact
match for plants from southeastern Brazil re-
ferred by Bentham to Af. cinerea Vell. Brown
was mistaken on both points, and Britton, evi-
dently dissatisfied, annotated the sheet with an
unpublished name. Subsequent collections from
the Orinoco valley show the same broad and
strongly flattened pod, characteristically hispid
with stout setae arising vertically from a pallid
pediment, attached to the foliage of Rusby’s
plants. In stipules and foliage these indeed do
resemble some examples of Brazilian Af. eflip-
tica, but the spurred cauline setae, the abbrevi-
ated calyx, the number of seeds per pod, and the
ecology and dispersal are all different. As it
emerges belatedly from the shadow of composite
M. pigra auct., M. orinocoénsis is seen to possess
the distinctive syndrome of glabrate venose stip-
ules, cat’s-claw prickles on stem and leaf-stalks,
spurred setae, diminished calyx and bread pod
breaking up into water-borne articles, these co-
inciding with a natural area of dispersal.

My concept of Vf. elliptica embraces all gen-
uine habbasias which have glabrous or almost
glabrous flowers together with simply campan-
ulate, non-paleaceous calyx and long-exserted fil-
aments, whether the capitula are ellipsoid, as
stipulated by Bentham, or globose. Variation in
length of the receptacle is commonplace both in
this species and in M. pe/fita and is independent
of variation in stature, pubescence, or other char-
acters. As shown in the synonymy I include here,
with considerable confidence, M4. cinerea Vel-
lozo. It is reasonable to suppose that the crude
drawing in Flora Fluminensis, which (excluding
the extraneous polyandrous flower) constitutes
the type of Af. cinerea, was based on a plant
found near Rio de Janeiro, and does not repre-
sent the kindred species of the lower Paraguay
valley to which it has been referred in modern
times. The misconception that there is a M. vel-
losiella (M. cinerea Vell., non Linn.) common to
tropical southeastern Brazil and northeastern ex-
tratropical Argentina arose in 1842 when Ben-
tham (J, Bot. (Hooker) 4: 401) misidentified as
M. cinerea Tweedie’s collections from Entre Rios
and La Plata of the species herein recognized as
the original Linnaean Af. pigra.
Like its common relative Af. pelliza, M. ellip-
tica varies much in pubescence and in devel-
opment of cauline and petiolar prickles, Poh] 1374
(K, NY) has relatively fong loose setae on stems
and leaf-stalks, and all are armed with subhori-
zontal broad-based aculei. More often the pu-
bescence is appressed, strigose rather than hispid,
and aculei appear and disappear erratically,
sometimes at different levels of one stem. It is
material of the latter type that Bentham associ-
ated with Argentine M. pigra, even though in
some cases (e.g., several specimens in hb. Mar-
tius, BR) the capitula are much longer than wide
and the flowers glabrous.

I am in full accord with Burkart (1948, I.c.)
that the riparian mimosa of the Parana valley
that he described and figured under the title of
M. vellosiella is a distinct entity peripheral to
closely allied Af. pigra auct. (M. pellita of this
account), and in the context of its relatives best
accorded specific status. Relatively low stature,
adventitiously rooting stems, relatively few pin-
nae and few, well-spaced leaflets, thin appressed
vesture, and broad papery pod consisting of ret-
atively broad articles enclosing proportionately
broader seeds distinguish it. I differ from Burkart
in the belief that it is endemic to Paraguay and
Argentina and that it is replaced on the Atlantic
coast of southern Brazil by a sibling species M.
elliptica, differing in glabrous corolla and much
longer filaments. The vexed nomenclature of the
group has been analyzed elsewhere (Barneby,
1989). The epithet veflosiella is typified by an
illustration in Vellozo’s icones, based presum-
ably on a plant from the vicinity of Rio de Ja-
neiro, and therefore not applicable to the species
considered here. Mimosa pigra Linn., based on
figures of a plant grown in Holland in the XVII
century, is the oldest name for any member of
the group dominated by polymorphic AZ. pellita.
The name is here applied to the species of La
Plata estuary on the basis of similarity in leaf-
formula, thin appressed vesture and relatively
distant leaflets not found elsewhere in the com-
plex.

As realized by Bentham, Mf. weddelliana is
closely related to M. pigra and its allies, which
it resembles in general vesture and in parallel
venulation of the leaflets. It is unique in the group,
however, in leaves reduced to one pair of pinnae,
and in the pod's long stipe. The conjugate pinnae
and coarse strigose indumentum suggest at first
sight a connection with sect. Mimosa, but the
flowers are diplostemonous and the resemblance
due to parallel evolution.
The few known collections of M. weddelliana
from the basin in western Brazil and Bo-
livia have dorsally glabrous stipules. The one
from Bahia, collected at a point more than 1500
km to the northeast, has dorsally gray-puberulent
stipules and cauline setae a trifle more slender.
In other respects all are essentially alike and un-
questionably conspecific.

This morphologicaily and ecologically spe-
cialized mimosa appears to be a monocarpic de-
tivative of Mf. pigra, which it resembles in the
long acicular interpinnal spicules and in the broad
but short articles of the fruit sealed at either end
by an interseminal septum. The low stature, re-
duced leaf-formula, ephemeral flowers with pal-
lid, shortly exserted filaments, and above all the
pod reduced to two (exceptionally three) articles,
the distal one broader, are highly distinctive.
Mimosa dormiens was probably collected first
by Sessé and Mocitio in Mexico. A specimen (G!)
distributed by Pavén and labelled
was thought by Bentham to have originated there.
The species is unlikely to have been encountered
by Pavon himself, or by Tafalla in Ecuador.

Mimosa strigillosa is notable among close kin-
dred for pliantly humifuse stems radiating from
a taproot and for broad veiny stipules. The plants
vary greatly in size of parts, in wet rich lowlands
becoming long-leaved, long-pedunculate, and
freely rooting from stem-nodes, and under drier
regimens small-leaved, short-pedunculate, and
seldom producing adventitious roots. In both
hemispheres occasional populations have hispid
rather than strigose-setose leaf-stalks and pedun-
cles, and very rarely, as in the type of M4. doli-
chocephala, minutely puberulent leaflets. In South
America the corolla-lobes are densely strigulose
externally, in North America only minutely so.
Like Burkart (1948) and Isely (1971b, 1973) I
perceive no significant racial division in M. sfri-
gillosa and, having studied all the relevant types,
fully endorse the synonymy proposed by Bur-
kart.
Burkart (1948) has suggested that the North
American range of M. strigillosa may be second-
ary and the species autochthonous only in South
America, home of its nearer relatives. Disjunc-
tions of similar pattern and magnitude are ex-
emplified by RAynchosia senna and Rh. diver-
sifolia (Grear, 1978) and by Chamaecrista
calycioides (Irwin & Barneby, 1982). I know of
no evidence that Af. strigi/fosa is other than na-
tive in Florida, Texas or Tamaulipas.

The foregoing description attributes to Af.
somnians unprecedented variation in leaf-for-
mula, in development of floral bracts, and in
pubescence or armament of stems and leaves.
Leaves of. Mf. somnians are diverse in length of
leaf-stalk, in proportionate lengths of petiole and
tachis, in number and length of pinnae and, gen-
erally correlated with length, in number of leaf-
lets per pinna. A great part of the whole range
of foliar variation may be seen in some individ-
ual plants between lower, middle and upper leaves
of one stem, the leaves at mid-stem being gen-
erally targer and more elaborately divided than
the rest, that is to say composed of more nu-
merous but not necessarily (or often) longer pin-
nae. The floral bracts of somnians are com-
monly narrow, 1-3-nerved and not over half the
length of the associated flower-bud just prior to
anthesis. Occasionally they may attain the length
of the buds without acquiring accessory nerves,
and quite rarely are dilated and several-nerved,
when they resemble striate stipules in form and
texture. In the extreme bracteose states, exem-
plified to varying degree by var. /puina and var.
velascoénsis, the capitulum becomes conelike
prior to anthesis, but this condition merely cul-
minates a graduated series and provides an in-
secure specific criterion. I arbitrarily assign great-
er weight to the further modification of the lower
bracts into a fused involucral collar and conse-
quently exclude from M. somnians the clearly
derived M. poculata and M. monacensis.
The cuticular emergences of M. somnians are
of five sorts, all common in Mimosa: a) minute
villi; b) forwardly appressed strigae; c) fine setae
capped with a livid nectary; d) vertical or widely
ascending plain setae, often tawny in color, and
e) laterally compressed, straight or incurved
prickles which appear to be homologous with
plain setae and, when short or slender, not clearly
distinguishable from them. Expression of these
types of trichome is capricious, and each is en-
countered in almost every possible combination
of absence, presence, density and dispersal in
plants otherwise alike. In search of correlations
between indumentum and other phenetic char-
acters or with geographic dispersal I successively
sorted all study material by presence/absence of
each type of trichome, without a priori assump-
tions as to taxonomic significance. It turned out
that in this complex fine villi, as expected from
general experience of the genus, are absolutely
fickle and independent of other characters. More
surprisingly, the visually and tactually arresting
viscid setae can come and go suddenly without
correlated changes. For example, prickly var.
sSomnians between Mexico and Panama is pre-
vailingly glandular, but random eglandular pop-
ulations (Hinton 11337 from Guerrero; E. Nei-
Son 2723 from Oaxaca; Davidse 2329 from
Nicaragua, all NY) not otherwise different, are
not rare in this region. The type-collection of AZ.
somnians, from the Magdalena vailey in Colom-
bia, is likewise a rare eglandular variant among
prevailingly viscid stock. Again, copious collec-
tions of var. viscida and var. lfeptocauilis from the
environs of Brasilia contain pairs of plants iden-
tical except in this one respect. On the other
hand, a dense hispid but eglandular pubescence,
sometimes mixed with weak aculei, and linked
with short petioles and often gray-villosulous
stipules and corolla-lobes, appears to be char-
acteristic of the planaltine subsp. /asiocarpa.
It is readily apparent that prickles vary greatly
in size and number between plants of a given
region and even between parts of one plant, wan-
ing at times to the proportions of scarcely dilated
setae; but while prickly plants are encountered
through the whole immense range of the species,
from Mexico to Argentina, unarmed ones are
not. A dispersal map differentiating solely be-
tween aculeate and non-aculeate Af. somnians
shows the former alone at and near the periphery
of the species-range, but relatively rare in eastern
Brazil; whereas the unarmed forms are concen-
trated in great numbers and variety on the Pla-
nalto and extend outside it only feebly to north-
eastern Brazil and Bolivia, and quite sporadically
further. The disparate ranges of aculeate and un-
armed M. somnians suggest divergent histories,
or different proclivities for dispersal (or surviv-
al), or both.
Turning from indumentum to leaf-formula, I
again sorted the materia! successively by number
of pinnae, by length of pinna-rachis, and by num-
ber of leaflets per pinna. Number of pinnae ap-
pears to be higher on the average in aculeate than
in unarmed M. somnians, yet is so capriciously
variable, even at times between leaves of one
stem, that it must be admitted an ineffectual,
even deceptive character, despite tradition to the
contrary. Length of pinnae and leaflet-number
are at least approximately linked, and together
are more stable than number of pinnae per leaf,
both on a single plant and among otherwise like
plants, whether aculeate or not. Flowers and fruits,
the latter almost as variable in indumentum as
the stems, are characteristic of ser, Somniantes
sensu lato and offer no tangible characters at or
below the specific level.
In his first paper on Mimosa Bentham (1842)
described four aculeate and (in what I here define
as M. somnians) six unarmed members. In his
monograph (1875) and Flora Brasiliensis he ac-
knowledged that supposed differences between
members of the armed group had broken down
and had no geographic plausibility; but he con-
tinued to maintain the unarmed ones, adding a
seventh. Modern collections referable to Ben-
tham’s unarmed group demonstrate intergra-
dient morphologies of the same order as, though
not quite coextensive with, those admitted to M.
somtnians sensu lato of Bentham’s last revision.
Little is known in detai) about the ecology of
M. somnians, but what is known and what can
be inferred from dispersal and collectors’ com-
ments is suggestive. Prickly subsp. sornmnians is
a weedy opportunist often abundant in season-
ally swampy lowland habitats, a precociously
flowering herb potentially bushy or scrambling
at maturity, The unarmed planaltine subspecies
are primarily plants of upland campo habitats,
with functionally herbaceous stems arising yearly
from lignescent rootstocks, doubtless selected by
intermittent fire but nevertheless still capable of
acquiring, in some cases and in protected micro-
habitats, leafless woody trunks. This broad gen-
eralization must be qualified to admit particular
exceptions, such as specialized unarmed var.
aquatica, or specialized aculeate var. deminuta.
Reflecting on the morphological variation
within Af. somnians, which superficially appears
chaotic, I discerned three major and one minor,
approximately concentric circles of affinity, here
titled subspecies, each successively less wide-
spread spatially and here modified edaphically,
In this view subsp. somnians, in which all types
of indumentum are at least potentially realized
and which has, by and large, the more elaborate
leaf-formula, emerges as the primitive stock,
which has proved sufficiently plastic to endure
extremes of climate between subtropical and hy-
laean without loss of identity. From this must
have arisen by selection unarmed and commonly
glabrescent subsp. viscida, ubiquitous in high-
land eastern Brazil and extending outside the ce-
rrado climax only into ecologically related cam-
po or rupestral habitats; the ecologically similar
and sympatric but less widespread subsp. Jasio-
carpa, in which simple setose eglandular indu-
mentum has become nearly stabilized; and fi-
nally the very local subsp. fongipes, which has
its own characteristic calyx and foliage, but may
be aculeolate or not.

This ecologically specialized variety differs
from var. somnians in abbreviated pinnae and
consequently few leaflets. Its slender growth-habit
and tiny capitula are nearly matched by one col-
lection (Plowman 9167, mun. Babagulandia, lat.
6°S6'S, NY) from a savanna habitat in northern
Goias, Brazil; but this has to 28 pairs of leaflets
in longer pinnae, The known range and habitat

dutosa var. crystatlina Irwin & Barneby.

seeded, the valves ascending-setose and com-
monly also finely villosulous, the articles (2.5-)3-
4.5 mm long.
This subspecies differs from the rest of M.
somnians principally in quality of the indumen-
tum, in which plain setae, often accompanied by
fine villi, predominate. It resembles subsp. vis-
cida in habit and ecology, but approaches subsp.
somnians in leaf-formula and occasional arma-
ture of prickles. It differs from sympatric subsp.
viscida in prevailingly shorter petioles, more nu-
merous pairs of pinnae, and shorter stipe of the
pods, but none of these characters is in itself
decisive.

Pohl’s two collections of var. dupulina, other
than Hatschbach 54035 (NY, collected in 1990)
still the only ones known to me, are in habit and
foliage identical with some examples of var. Ja-
siocarpa, but are not identical to one another.
The lectotype, chosen over Poh! 1363 because
its dorsally pubescent bracts agree better with the
protologue and because its provenance is exactly
known, has both the setose pubescence of subsp.
fasiocarpa and a copious undercoat of fine villi
that extends to the back of the stipules, bracts,
and calyx-lobes. This undercoat is reduced in
Poh! 1363 to a rudiment. The dilated floral bracts,
to which the epithet refers, may perhaps have
arisen by independent mutation from more and
less villosulous variants of var. fasiocarpa in the
same way that var. velascoénsis is surmised to
have arisen from var. viscida. While there is no
means of ascertaining at present whether or not
var. lupulina exists as a discrete self- perpetuating
entity independent of var. /asiocarpa, its close
kinship to the latter cannot be gainsaid.

The type-population of var. aquatica appeared
in the field strikingly different from var. leprto-
caulis in its wet habitat and pluripinnate sub-
sessile leaves, but the inflorescence, and the pod
except that its stipe is subobsolete, are essentially
the same. I take var. aquatica to be a local de-
rivative of Af. somnians subsp. viscida adapted

Closely resembling egiandular var. viscida, the

appressed or narrowly ascending strigae to 1-2

This stands in relationship to eglandular var.
viscida as does var. fupulina to var. fasiocarpa.
Its sporadic oceurrence within the range of var,
viscida suggests that it may consist of a set of
paralle] mutations generating dilated floral bracts
with stipuliform, striately nerved blades. Until
this hypothesis can be tested var. velascoénsis
deserves some taxonomic rank, but certainly not
independent of M. sommnians sensu lato.

In habit resembling var. viscida, the stems vir-
gately erect from xylopodium 4-20 dm, either
unarmed subglabrous or remotely aculeate and
glandular-setose, simple or paniculate and efoli-
ate distally; lf-stks of lvs at mid-stem 10-19 cm,
the petiole 7-14 cm; pinnae 2—5-jug., the rachis
of longer ones cm, their Ifts to 30-47-
jug. and to mm long; floral bracts el-
liptic or lanceolate 0.6-2 mm, 1—5-nerved; calyx
0.9-1.6 mm, the delicately striate tube 0.7—1 mm,
unequally 2—4-toothed, the longest tooth ovate
0,3-0.6 mm; corolla 3.1-4 mm; pods (of var.
longipes) +60 x 5 mm and +6-seeded, at base
attenuate into a stipe 1 cm, the valves glabrous,
the elliptic articies 11-13 mm.
The subsp. /ongipes is well differentiated from
other forms of somnians by slenderly long-
petiolate leaves and by relatively large and firm-
textured, unequally toothed calyx. The elongate
articles of the pod, at present known only in var.
Jongipes, are equally notable. The small known
range of subsp. /ongipes lies within that of subsp.
viscida var. viscida, which otherwise resembles
it except that the stems are never aculeolate as
in var. possensis.

Close kinship between glaucula and M.
somnians is manifest in venation of leaflets and
striate corollas. The form of Af. somnians most
nearly resembling M. glaucula is its var. lepto-
caulis. This shares with Af. g/aucuia a rudimen-
tary, commonly eglandular pubescence and rel-
atively short pinnae, but is never even remotely
aculeolate and has leaflets at least twice as many
and less than half as large. The extremely slender
M. leptorachis, with pinna-rachis reduced yet
further to less than one centimeter in length, dif-
fers as well in leaf-formula of iii-iv/3-7 (not ii/
8-11) and in a Jeafy paniculate, not pseudora-
cemose efoliate inflorescence.

The affinity of M. somnambulans to M. som-
nians expressed in similarity of habit, foliage and
floral structure is so close that the only question
confronting the taxonomist is the rank to which
it is entitled. Because the plant is unarmed but
glandular-setulose, it is best compared with 4.
somnians var. leptocaulis. The ample leaflets,
which are more than twice the size of any en-
countered among the multitudinous races of var.
leptocaulis (or elsewhere in M. somnians) and as
a consequence more elaborately venulose, to-
gether with stipules narrower and fewer-veined
and a more diffusely branched and further ex-
serted panicle of pseudoracemes contribute to a
strongly individual facies. I provisionally eval-
uate M. somnambulans as standing outside the
orbit of its racially complex relative (and likely
precursor) M. somnians, and suppose it to be a
microspecies recently derived by saltatory evo-
lution from it.

The description of 4. monacensis is prepared
from specimens misidentified by Bentham as M.
bijuga (Benth., non Vell., now Af. poculata),
specimens which incidentally provided the fruit-
ing characters assigned to M. bijuga in Flora
Brasiliensis. They resemble M. poculaia in di-
lated stipuliform floral bracts, of which the low-
est are irreguiarly fused into an involucral collar;
but differ in trailing aculeate stems charged with
fine villi and many viscid setules, and in pubes-
cent flowers, The indumentum of mixed prickles,
stipitate glands and simple hairs suggests a more
direct connection with M. somnians subsp. som-
nians, but this is normally shrubby prior to an-
thesis, has (like M4. bijuga, despite its epithet)
more than two pairs of pinnae in mature cauline
leaves, and minute 1- or faintly 3-nerved florat
bracts.
The epithet ionacensis celebrates the illustri-
ous Bavarian botanists who conceived and con-
tributed to Flora Brasiliensis.

Mimosa poculata is one of several minor, geo-
graphically restricted satellites of the M4. som-
nians complex, essentially like Af. somnians var.
leptocaulis except for the broad floral bracts, the
lowest united into a cupular involucre. It is also
very close to A4. somnians var. velascoénsis, but
has fewer pinnae and larger floral bracts. The pod
described by Bentham is taken from Martius 1793
(M), here referred to Af. monacensis.

Mimosa leptorachis, collected once in 1818 and
not since seen, is a small satellite or derivative
of polymorphic M. somnians and different from
all forms of it in short paucifoliolate pinnae. Ba-
hian M4. glaucula approaches it in leaflet-number,
but has only two pairs of pinnae per leaf and is
an altogether smaller subshrub. The type-local-
ity, if correctly recorded (as was not always the
case) by Martius, should be somewhere on the
west slope of Sa. do Espinhago between Conten-
das and the S. Francisco river. When the pod is
discovered the status of Af. feptorachis in relation
10 Af. somnians will require reassessment.

the filaments are pink when first expanded and
fade whitish. Neither prickles nor flower-color

At anthesis Af. brachycarpa closely resembles
the bracteose varieties of Mf. somnians, but may
be distinguished by dissection of the ovary, which
contains not more than six ovules (vs, 7-15 for
M. somnians). In fruit the striate corolla mar-
cescent at base of the short subsessiJe pod, the
valves of which fall away from the replum with-
out articulation, is an unmistakable combina-
tion. The low ovule-number is compensated by
the number of pods that reach maturity, these
usually forming an umbelliform head reminis-
cent of Ad. camporum.

The concept of 44. microcephata is here ex-
panded to include aculeate M4. cataractae Ducke
and analyzed into two geographic subspecies and
five varieties. As indicated by Irwin (1966: 103),
the differences in leaf-formula and seed-number
inadvertently reversed in Irwin’s discussion) be-
tween M. microcephaia and M. plumaeifolia
Kleinh., which is indistinguishable from M. cata-
ractae, are indecisive. The aculeate plants have
been described as relatively tall sarmentose shrubs
and the unarmed ones as smaller savanna bush-
es, but field-labels suggest that in open places
such as rock-islets in river rapids the prickly ones
can form either stiff free-standing bushes or trail-
ing subshrubs, not materially different, except in
presence of aculei, from genuine Mf. microcepha-
in comparable habitats.
The close relationship of M. microcephaia is
with polymorphic M. somnians, likewise either
armed or unarmed, from which it differs prin-
cipaily in the 1- or locally 3-nerved, not 5-sev-
eral-nerved corolla lobes, and in the lateral at-
tachment of the cauline setae, a feature that has
passed unnoticed in the literature. Kindred of
more local dispersal and native in similar riv-
erine and outcrop habitats in Amazonia and the
Guayana Highland are Af. cailiandroides, similar
in all respects except for dilated and basifixed
setae of stems and leaf-stalks, Af. surumuénsis
distinguished by plumose setae, and M.
carpoides, similar in setae but different in greatly
altered feaf-formula.

The varieties microcephala and communis are
essentially identical except in venulation of the
corolla-lobes, a character that bears on the re-
lationship between M. microcephala and M.
somnians, not perceived by Bentham. The var.
microcephala has been collected repeatedly, and
1o the exclusion of var. communis, in the envi-
sons of Puerto Ayacucho, but upstream at Sana-
Tiapo and downstream on Cerro San Borja the
two varieties occur in close proximity, differing,
at least at Cerro San Borja, further in color of
filaments, pink in var. microcephala (Wurdack
& Monachino 39826, NY) and white in var. com-
munis (Wurdack & Monachino 39842, NY, fur-

sommians var. deminuta, and it seems possible
that the venulose corolla-lobes of var. micro-
cephala may be derived by introgressive hybrid-
ization from this source. If other populations of
var. communis that are sympatric with var. mi-
crocephaia have the multiovulate pod of Wur-
dack & Monachino 39842 they may eventually
deserve taxonomic status.

Mimosa brachycarpoides is closely related to
compatriot Af. microcephala and to M. surt-
muénsis, but differs from both in short, few-pin-
nate leaves. Its basally calcarate cauline setae are
scaberulous, which suggests affinity to Af. suru-
muénsis, but the corolla-lobes are simply
l-nerved as in microcephaia var. communis.
From the latter it differs not alone in leaf-formula
but also in a relatively large calyx asymmetrically
recessed on the side opposed to the bract. It is
an odd circumstance that typical M, microcepha-
ia has been collected close to the type-lovality of
M. brachycarpoides (O. Huber 3788, NY, US),
but this is notably different in its elaborate leaves
and 3-nerved corolla-lobes. In general habit and
foliage M. brachycarpoides recalls the distantly
allopatric Af. brachycarpa, but this is safely dis-
tinguished, as is M4. surumuénsis, by striately sev-
eral-nerved corolla-lobes characteristic of ser.
Bipinnatae (sens. str.).

Mimosa scaberrima, not previously affiliated
in sect. Habbasia, is closely related to the nearly
sympatric M. catliandroides and the remotely al-
lopatric Af, brachycarpoides, both of which are
similar in growth-habit. It resembles the first in
dilated, although basally only thickened and not
spurred cauline setae, but differs from it in few,
at most 4 and not to 7-14 pairs of pinnae per
leaf, and in the strongly L-, not 6-7-nerved co-
rolla-lobes. In leaf-formula and in 1-nerved co-
rolla-lobes it resembles 4. brachycarpoides, but
differs in lance-triangular, dorsally flattened ecal-
carate, not slender subterete and basally spurred,
cauline setae, and in a minute calyx about one
tenth, not nearly one half as long as the corolla.

This localized, morphologically well-marked
species is related to 4. camporum, which is
ilar in striate stipules and narrow pod but which
differs in erect monocarpic growth-habit, smaller
capitula, and much less dilated stipules. Harms
made note of this kinship when he described
steinbachii from Buenavista. His earlier M. nep-
tuntoides, based on meagre starveling specimens
from the Yapacani valley close to Buenavista,
had been likened to M. dormiens and perhaps
for this reason was overlooked.
The earliest collection of M. neptunioides
known to me was collected in Bolivia in the
Northern Hemisphere winter of 1830-1831 by
the French explorer Alcide C. V. d’Orbigny (717,
P).

Although known as yet from only one collec-
tion, M4. cisparanensis appears specifically dis-
tinct from the obviously related M. neptunioides
in stiffly erect, not trailing stems, weak scattered
prickles, reduction of the true petioles to the leaf-
pulvinus (the first pair of pinnae consequently
arising as it were directly next the stem), and
particularly in the broad pod comosely hispid
with much longer setae. In pod and armament
it resembles distantly allopatric 44. occidentalis,
but this differs fundamentally in number of pin-
na-pairs.

on stems, leaf-axes, and floral bracts with fine
spreading setae and either totally eglandular or
only microscopically viscidulous under the ca-
pitula. A local form, found so far only at the far
western end of the species-range, differs in simply
puberulent stems and leaf-axes and in the more
or less gland-setulose capitula. The fruit of this
form being unknown, its status is somewhat
doubtful and subject to evaluation.

McVaugh’s note (1987, sub MM. orthocarpa)
clearly brought out the differences between the
specimens cited above and genuine M. ortho-
carpa, which has one-nerved stipules, moriform
capitula, and armature of stout vulnerant aculei
(as opposed to weak setaculei). If correctly sub-
ordinated to M. occidentalis, they should prove
to have a short, 2-3 seeded, sessile craspedium,
unlike the narrow, actually or potentially 4-8-
seeded, stipitate fruit of Af. orthocarpa, It is
curious to note that var. occidentalis, var. novo-
galiciana and M. somnians have all been co!-
lected within a few kilometers of the city of
Tepic, which raises the possibility that var, novo-
galiciana is a recent hybrid combining the glan-
dutar indumentum of M. somnians with the
striately nerved stipules and one-nerved corolla-
lobes of Af. occidentalis. The leaves and leaflet
venation of the three taxa are scarcely distin-
guishable, Two ovary-dissections from the type-
number of var. nove-galiciana yielded four ovules
apiece, foretelling a small occidentalis-like pod.

Mimosa camporum forms, with Mexican and
Honduran M. occidentalis B. & R. and Bolivian
M. neptunioides Harms, a small group of octan-
drous species that resemble M. somnians in stri-
ate stipules and florat bracts and in form and
venation of leaflets, but differ in faintly t -nerved,
not striately several-nerved corolla-lobes. In its
immediate group it is distinguished by mono-
carpic duration, extremely small capitula borne
on abbreviated peduncle, and shortly exserted
filaments, The flowers are ephemeral, their fila-
ments being fully expanded only during moming
hours, and the capitula are usually highly fmitful,
most or all ovaries maturing at least one seed,
commonly 2-3 and at times 4 seeds. The flowers
appear to be autogamous, which would account
for perpetuation within sympatric populations of
small differences in indumentum, branching, and
leaf-formuia,
The rich synonymy of M. camporum testifies
to variation in stature, setose pubescence, leaf-
formula and diameter of capitulum observed
among early collections of the species, a variation
which Bentham eventually perceived as taxo-
nomically insignificant. The type of Af. campo-
rum is of medium height, relatively short-hispid
with none but slender setae, and has capitula
about 4 mm in diameter. Those of M. flavescens
and M. flaviseta are more robust plants densely
hispid with setae partly dilated into setaculei that
may lose their flagelliform tip in age and then
resemble genuine prickles. The types of A. pusil-
fa and M. martensis represent not infrequent
populations of depauperate, rapidly maturing in-
dividuals in which only (or mostly) juvenile fo-
liage, with sometimes much reduced leaf-for-
mula, is produced. These short-lived, sometimes
ephemeral populations occur sporadically
through much of the range of M4. camporum
(Guerrero, Mexico to Martinique in the Antilles
and Rondénia in Brazil) and vary like their most
robust counterparts in pubescence and size of
pod. The contrast between almost sympatric
populations can be very remarkable. On Marti-
nique, for example, Duss collected in 1880 a ro-
bust setaculeate plant (Duss 1248, NY) with leaf-
formula attaining vi/34 which well matches
so-called M. flavescens; on the same island Sastre
(7424, 7552, both NY, P) has lately encountered
a diminutive, thinly setulose form with leaf-for-
mula about i-ii/5-13, sometimes fruiting when
only 2-5 cm tall. In the context of the insular
flora these suggest two distinct species, The taller
plant, which Duss (Fl. phan. Antill. frang. 245.
1897) thought to have been introduced with fer-
tilizer, closely matches examples from the island
of Grenada and from continental South and Cen-
tral America. The diminutive ones discovered
by Sastre, which may be native but formerly
overlooked, are nearly matched by collections
from Guarico, Venezuela (Pittier 12505, NY;
Davidse 4265, NY) and are similar to the typus
of M. pusilla from Nicaragua. A collection from
Acapulco, Guerrero (Palmer 9, GH, NY, referred
by Robinson, 1898, to pusifia) combines in
one planta relatively robust diffuse growth-hab-
it, distantly setaculeate cauline pubescence, alow
leaf-formula of i-iii/ 10-13 and tiny few-flowered
capitula. Only controlled cultures will demon-
strate whether these depauperate, seemingly ju-
venile forms of M4. camporum, that are diverse
in some details of structure and scattered through
the range of the species, are genetically or only
edaphically controlled, Until this question is an-
swered the taxonomic status of Af. pusifia and
the very similar but not identical M4. martensis
wil] remain controversial.

Now known from nine collections, most of
them quite recent and all from the sources of rio
Aquidaban in east-central Paraguay, M. rojasii
turns out to be unexpectedly variable in detail.
The type-collections have ellipsoid capitula and
essentially glabrous leaflets, but subglobose ca-
Pitula now appear to be commoner, and the se-
tose element of the indumentum may be much
accentuated, the leaflets becoming either glan-
dular-fimbriolate or sparsely setose-ciliolate.
In gross appearance the more setose state of
M. rojasii recalls Mexican M. occidentalis, but it
differs in strong woody root associated with cam-
po habitat, and lacks interpinnal spicules on the
leaf-stalk. Its close near relatives are both en-
demic to the upper Paraguay basin: M4. chacoén-
sis different in spiciform capitula, and M. jose-
Phina distinguished (inter alia) by three-nerved
corolla-lobes and much longer 9-12-seeded pod.

Mimosa josephina has many features in com-
mon with Paraguayan M. rojasii: striately nerved
stipules and floral bracts; partly glandular in-
dumentum; leaflets coarsely venulose dorsally in
a characteristic design; and plumply ellipsoid ca-
pitula. The pair seem surely allied, but differ sig-
nificantly in stature and pubescence, in venation
of corolia-lobes, and in length of pod correlated
with ovule- and seed-number. These differences,
set out in the key to ser. Rojasianae and in the
foregoing diagnosis of Af, josephinae, are
strengthened by a gap of some 7() km between
their known ranges, to the east and west of the
Paraguai valley respectively. The less closely re-
lated but almost or actually sympatric M. mep-
tunioides differs from M. josephina in diffuse his-
pid-hirsute but eglandular stems, stipules at once
larger and more elaborately striate-venulose, few
(2-4, not 5-8) pairs of pinnae in larger leaves,
and enlarged floral bracts that conceal the flawer-
buds prior to anthesis.

Mimosa chacoénsis resembles M. rojasit and
M. neptunioides in striately nerved stipules, and
the latter particularly in number of pinnae and
venation of but it is instantly distin-
guished from both by spicate, not capitate flow-
ers. It differs further from M. rojasii, endemic to
campo habitats on and near Sa. de Amambay
along the Paraguay—Brazil border, in humifuse
stems, absence of glandular setulae, short pinnae
bearing only 11-14, not 15-30 pairs of dorsally
villosulous (not glabrous) leaflets, longer pedun-
cles, and only very shortly monadelphous fila-
ments; and further from M4. neptunioidesin much
smaller 9-11-, not 30-50-nerved stipules, tack
of interpinnal spicules, and about twice as many
pinnae per leaf, The distantly allopatric 14. mi-
randa, technically similar in spicate inflores-
cence, has aculeate stems, leaf-stalks armed with
long interpinnal spicules, and different leaf-for-
mula and leaflet-venation.

Bentham's concept of M. regnellii, of necessity
narrow because based exclusively on Regnell’s
plants from Caldas, is here materially enlarged
southward to incorporate Af. supersetosa Burkart
and allied forms from Parana and Sta. Catarina.
When Burkart described Af. supersetosa he com-
pared it, not with true Af. regneillii, which he
knew primarily from description and from the
plate in Flora brasiliensis, but with the then un-
described M. deceptrix, equivalent to the species
that passes in Flora ilustrada catarinense as M.
vegnellii. From M, deceptrix Burkart’s new spe-
cies is easily and properly distinguished, but from
genuine M4. regneillii it differs only in smaller,
more condensed leaves, which lend it, however,
a certain distinction of mien that coincides with
extratropical dispersal. The type-collections of
M. regnellii have linear-oblong leaflets propor-
tionately narrower than those of M. supersetasa,
but Sa. de Caldas later yielded (Afosén 1966, S)
leaflets of semi-ovate type. As flowers and pods
of M. regnellii and M. supersetosa are nearly
identical it is no longer possible to maintain them
as independent species.
In eastern Parana M. regnellii is subject to
variation in indumentum and leaf-formula that
appears related to dispersal and prompts me to
distinguish, in addition to var. supersetosa, a gla-
brate var. exuta found in highland campo north
and west of Curitiba, and from the neighborhood
of Ponta Grossa a var. grossiseta, different in the
coarsely dilated setae of leaf-stalks and in pod
strigose with short bulbous-based setae.

The range of M. regnellii var. supersetosa is
nearly coextensive with that of M. micropteris,
but it differs in broader, distinctly 2-3-nerved
leaflets puberulent commonly on both faces, al-
ways so beneath. It is described, also, as a smaller
shrub, seldom surpassing one meter in height,
including the virgate pseudoracemes. In the few
fruiting specimens seen the pod is shorter, 1-2-
rather than 2—4-seeded; but I have vainly sought
differences in calyx, which varies somewhat in
depth of dissection, or in corolla. Burkart de-
scribed two varieties of AZ. supersetosa, supposed
to differ not only in quality of setose vesture but
also in size or length of leaf, raceme and capit-
ulum. The differences are blurred in the material
seen by me and are moreover contradicted in
Burkart’s own detailed description of each va-
riety. I therefore evaluate var. ryfohispidula as a
minor variant of M. regneillii var. supersetosa.

My present concept of M, micropteris includes
three taxa recognized by Burkart: A4. micropteris
sens. str., Mf. regnellii sensu Burkart (non Ben-
tham), and M. regneflii var. pungens Burkart.
The two last are essentially alike except for the
latter’s infrastipular aculei occurring at random
points along the branches, aculei that may be
present or absent in stems from one collection
(e.g., Reitz & Klein 17579, cited by Burkart, 1979:
252 as unarmed Af. regneillii, but armed at NY);
moreover their ranges are nearly coextensive.
Referred herein to M. micropteris var. pungens,
these differ collectively from genuine Af. mi-
cropteris only in the leaflets, which are short,
broad and glabrous in the latter but a little longer,
proportionately narrower, and finely setose-cil-
iolate in var. pungens. Typical var, micropteris
is allopatrically dispersed over a small tract of
campo country to the north and east of var. pun-
gens. However, in the municipio of Guarapuava
in Paranda there occur populations in which leaf-
lets proportionately proper to var. aculeata are
either marginally glabrous like var. micropteris
or weakly ciliolate, but in both cases coincide
with aculeate branches. Burkart suggested that
one of these (Hatschbach 13380) might represent
the hybrid M. micropteris x regnellii, but it is
equally likely to be simply intermediate, the lo-
cality lying at the eastern edge of the range of
var. pungens, adjacent to that of var. micropteris.
As here interpreted, Af, micropteris is entirely
extratropical, ranging southward from upper rio
Trararé on the Paulo—Parana boundary to cen-
tral and eastern Sta. Catarina. The mature plants
are shrubs, sometimes weakly arborescent, with
several or many trunks repeatedly branched up-
ward into a broad crown of foliage from which
the inflorescences project about 0.5—2 dm. The
true M. regneilii, which Burkart inew only from
a photograph, came originally from Caldas in
southern Minas Gerais, a point distant 300 km
to the northeast of the northernmost known sta-
tion for M. micropteris var. micropteris and 500
km northeast of the nearest for var. aculeata (=M.
regneillii sensu Burkart, ex parte), It is a relatively
little known mimosa, apparently of the func-
tionally herbaceous, virgate habit exemplified by
M,. myriophylia and M. candelabrum, but may
be distinguished from M. micropteris even in
truncated specimens by the forwardly displaced
midrib of the leaflets.

This handsome campo mimosa, which was
perceived by Per Dusén to be allied to but (in
herbarium notation) different from M. regnellii,
was mistaken by Burkart for that species. It dif-
fers from var. regneliii in virgate habit, with few
large leaves below mid-stem and an extremely
long efoliate and multicapitulate pseudoraceme,
branched or not, overtopping the foliage by 5-8
dm, and further by concolorous, symmetrically
linear-oblong leafiets with a centric costa either
solitary or accompanied on each side by a nar-
towly intramarginal nerve, In the asymmetri-
cally costate leaflets of M. regneilii the midrib is
accompanied on the posterior side alone by pri-
mary nerves and the margin of the leaflets is
rimmed with pallid tissue. The habit of Af. reg-
nellii, when all varieties are considered, is some-
what diverse, but the mature plants are usually
distinctly fruticose, with defoliate trunks and.
densely leafy hornotinous branches. The variet-
ies of M. regnellii sympatric or nearly so with
M, deceptrix in eastern Parana differ further in
short leaves and few pinnae.

This distinctive mimosa resembles in virgate
habit and simple long-exserted pseudoraceme
some of the coarser unijugate Brevipedes, but has
the pluripinnate leaves of ser. Piurijugae. It dif-
fers from M4. myriophylia, which has rather sim-
ilar leaves and inflorescence, most significantly
in details of the larger capitula: longer bracts and
flowers; filaments pink (not red); smaller anthers;
3-5 (not solitary) ovules; and a normally devel-
oped (not abbreviated claviform) style. The more
nearly related M. altoparanensis is readily dis-
tinguished by armament and leaf-formula.
The var. joergensenii does not amount to a
taxonomically significant variant. The isotypus
at NY has peduncles to 2 cm long, and I can
detect no real difference between it and other
material of the species either in outline of the
capitula or in the quality of setose pubescence.

As realized by Chodat and Hassler, M. aito-
paranensis is closely akin to the also Paraguayan
M. candelabrum, but I agree with Burkart that
it deserves independent specific status, It differs
from M. candelabrum not only in the armature,
but in leaf-size and leaf-formula, in smaller ca-
pitula mostly fasciculate at each node of the pseu-
doraceme, in shorter corollas, and in the pod
breaking up when ripe into independently falling
articles.

Mimosa myriophylia and M. caillidryas (which
see for commentary) together are diffeent from
all other members of the genus in the relatively
immense anthers that coincide with a short stout
style enclosed in or scarcely emergent from the
corolla. Auguste de Saint-Hilaire first noted the
short style in February 1821 (Fieldbook C2, no.
2654, P) in plants encountered on rio Mbutui
near San Borja on the Brazilian side of the Uru-
guay river, and Burkart in the protologue of AZ.
pluriracemosa (1947) and in description and fig-
ure of the same in his revision of Argentine
mosa (1948) wondered about its normality. It
appears to be a constant feature of M. myrio-
phylla and M. callidryas, the flowers of which
seem to be adapted to self-pollination. Burkart
cannot have known that the type of 4. myrio-
phyilla is likewise brachystylous, for he compared
M. pluriracemosa in the first place with Af. can-
delabrum and in the second with A. regnellii,
both dolichostylous and small-anthered, and
guite distinct in other features also. Mimosa plu-
riracemosa was thought by Burkart to differ from
M. myriophylia in slightly fewer pairs of pinnae
and sometimes larger leaflets, but these differ-
ences are poorly expressed in the material now
available, and do not coincide with geographical
dispersal. There is also some variation in length
of the peduncles, the capitula in highland Minas
Gerais and S, Paulo being sessile, but in lowland
habitats along the lower Parana and Uruguai riv-
ers often shortly stalked. But stalked and almost
sessile capitula are found among syntypes of AZ.
myriophylla collected by Riedel (287, 312 re-
spectively, NY).
The exact provenance of the two collections
of M. myriophylia described by Bentham is un-
known. Sello’s specimens have neither number
nor locality ascribed to them, and could have
been collected either in tropical or southern ex-
tratropical Brazil. The Pombal of Riedel’s label,
which Bentham surmised to be in Minas Gerais,
has not been identified, and no such place is
mentioned in Urban’s itineraries of Lund or Rie-
del.
I am grateful to Dr. M. Lavin for procuring
photographs of part of the type of M. plurira-
cemosa at LIL.

Part of the type-collection of M. callidryas was
identified by Harms as 44. myriophylia, the spe-
cies to which it is indeed closely related, being
similar in growth-habit and sharing with it these
unusual floral characters: dark red filaments
bearing exceptionally large anthers; a short thick
style much surpassed by the filaments; and a sol-
itary ovule. Differences that I consider of specific
consequence are the greatly diminished (not large
paleaceous-pappiform) calyx, fewer leaflets per
pinna, and spreading hispid indumentum not yet
encountered in 44. myriophyila. While the style
of these two species is shorter than in any other
mimosa of southeastern Brazil, that of 44. cai-
is ordinarily shortly exserted from the
corolla at anthesis, whereas that of M. myrio-
phylia is fully included in it.
The epithet callidryas is derived from the name
of the type-locality, Capaio Bonito. According to
Dusén’s labels this place is in Parana, but the
Capao Bonito near 24°S in southern Sao Paulo
is a possible alternative.

Bentham associated glazioui with the es-
sentially herbaceous Af. pudica and M. polydac-
tyla, from which it differs in well-spaced pinnae,
relatively well-developed calyx, and apparently
truly shrubby life-form, characters which togeth-
er strongly suggest affinity to ser. Myriophyliae.
Yellow flowers, as described by Glaziou, are
known elsewhere in haplostemonous Mimosa
only coincident with the stellate or arborescently
branched setae of sect. Calothamnos; the color
requires direct observation of fresh material. Un-
til the fruit is described, the relationship of M.
glazioui will remain open to interpretation. The
pubescence seen by Bentham
between the tawny bristles of the stem appears
to my eye to be simple puberulence,

310. Mimosa polycarpa Kunth, Mimoses 8.
1819.—Typus infra sub var. polycarpa indi-
catur.
Subshrubs and bushy shrubs attaining 7-20 dm,
often resembling M. xanthocentra in habit and
foliage and like subsp. xanthocentra armed at all
or most nodes with infrastipular broad-based
stramineous acudei (1-)2—7(-8) mm, the virgate
or paniculately branched stems, If-stks and pe-
duncles either hispid-pilose or subappressed-
strigose with fine tapering setae to
mm mixed with minute puberulence, the oli-
vaceous subconcolorous Ifts either glabrous or
minutely puberulent above, beneath thinly ap-
pressed-setose and sometimes also puberulent,
discontinuously or subcontinuously setose-cili-
ate, the globose or plumply ellipsoid capitula
mostly 2—3-nate, rarely solitary in the axil of con-
temporary lvs, the immature ones sometimes
forming a hysteranthously foliate pseudcracerme.
Stipules firmly chartaceous, lanceolate or lance-
elliptic 5-8(-11) <x 1+2.4 mm, striately I-11-
nerved from base, dorsally either puberulent, or
setose, or rarely glabrous, almost always setose-
ciliate, persistent. Leaf-statks including sensitive
pulvinus (5-)7-27(-40) mm, at middle 0.4-0.7
mm diam., shallowly grooved ventrally and
bearing an ascending spicule + 1-2 mm between
the one pair of pinnae, rachis of pinnae 3-8 cm,
the interfoliolar segments to 1.2-3.5 mm; lfts 12-
33(-35)-jug., subdecrescent at each end of rachis,
the first pair 0.6-2 mm distant from lance-subu-
late paraphyllidia 0.6-2 mm, the blades linear or
linear-lanceolate from abtusangulate base, acute
or apiculate, straight or obscurely arched for-
ward, those near mid-rachis (6-)6.5-12(-15) x
mm, times as long as
wide, all veinless above, the subcentric midrib
with 1—2(-3) weak and short posterior nerves
either prominulous or merely discolored be-
neath. Peduncles 4-17(-20) mm; capituda with-
out filaments 5-5.5 mm diam., prior to anthesis
either conelike or submoriform depending on
length of bracts, these oblanceolate, elliptic-ob-
ovate or rhombic- oblanceolate + 1,5—3 mm, be-
yond middle pectinately setulose-ciliate, mucro-
nate by excurrent midrib, the blade either
glabrous or minutely puberulent dorsally; flowers
4-merous 4-androus, some lower ones stami-
nate; calyx (further described under either
minute or asymmetrically paleaceous, not over
1 mm; corollas narrowly funnelform 2-2.8 mm,
the ovate cymbiform, strongly keeled but oth-
erwise scarcely thickened lobes 0.65-0.9 x 0.4—
0.5 mm, dorsally glabrous or microscopically pa-
pillate-puberulent; filaments pick or lilac-pink,
exserted (4,5-)5-7.5(-8) mm. Pods of well-fer-
tilized capitula to 10-18, sessile, in profile nar-
rowly oblong (10—)13-21(-25) x 4-5 mm, (24)3—
the shallowly undulate replum 0.4—
0.55 mm wide, abruptly produced at apex into
a subulate point 1—-1.5 mm and armed with pluri-
seriate straight stramineous setae to (2-)2.5-
3.5(-4) mm, the papery, at first green but early
brownish-stramineous valves colliculate over
each seed, at once puberulent and hispid with
suberect setae shorter and more slender than those
of replum, when ripe separating from replum and
dividing into rhombic or almost square, bicon-
vex indehiscent, free-falling articles 2.5-4.5(-5)
mum long; seeds rnombic-obovoid-lentiform 2.9-
3.4 x 2.5-2.9 mm, the testa dull brown-oliva-
ceous, often fuscous-spotted.
In overall facies M. polycarpa resembles armed
varieties of M. xanthocentra, but is effectively
distinguished by a spicule at apex of petioles, by
an either minute truncate or asymmetrically
paleaceous, not radially symmetrical pappiform
calyx, and almost always by glabrous, not gray-
puberulent flowers, Bentham’s concept of Ad.
polycarpa expressed in Flora brasiliensis (1876)
encompassed all then available examples of AZ.
xanthocentra vat. xanthocentra and var. mansii.
Burkart’s refined definition of the species (1948)
is here adopted, but some internal adjustment is
required, Burkart admittedly saw neither the type
nor the protologue of M4. polycarpa and misap-
plied the epithet to the subcordilleran Argentine
variety herein segregated as var. subandina. He
was unaware that the calyx of Kunth’s plant was
truncate, like that of east-Argentine var. spegaz-
zingi, not asymmetrically paleaceous like that of
var. subandina, The type of M. polycarpa ap-
pears almost exactly like average var. spegazzi-
nii, except for relatively few and large leaflets
and high-montane Penivian habitat, remote from
the main home of the species in the middle Para-
guai basin. Further collections from Peru are re-
quired before it can be stated unequivocally that
two distinct taxa exist, for it is not impossible
that the original 4. polycarpa of Humboldt and
Bonpland was intreduced in the vicinity of the
old Inca capital of Cajamarca. The situation in
Peru is complicated today by var. redundans (see
below) in which the leaf-spicules, leaflets and ca-
lyx of var. polycarpa are combined with the one-
nerved stipules of sympatric M. incarum. Field
observation of var. redundans is much needed.
Burkart pointed out that the two varieties of Af.
polycarpa native to Argentina differ not only in
form of the calyx but also in pubescence of the
upper face of leaflets, this present in the east but
absent in the west. However, much of the Par-
aguayan material that I refer to var. spegazzinii,
because of a minute glabrous calyx, has leaflets
hairless above, and Burkart’s reliance on this ac-
cessory differential character has proved exces-
sive,

stantially in pubescence, in lack of spicule at tip

glance Af. williamsit may easily be
mistaken for a hispid form of M. pudica, but
differs in these features: both leaf-stalk and pin-
na-rachises serially aculeate in the manner of
subser. Castae; conspicuously spiculate leaf-
stalks; and pinnae separated along leaf-rachis by
relatively wide intervals. 1 speculate that its clos-
est ally is M4. palycarpa, in relation to which it
stands as does MM. verecunda to M. xanthocentra
in subser. Pudicae, the two to four pairs of pinnae
being in each case independently derived by re-
duplication from a conjugate-pinnate forebear.
The two known examples of Mf. williamsii are
different in small details, the Peruvian plant dif-
fering from the Bolivian type in facially glabrous,
not puberulent leaflets, and in symmetrical, not
minutely spathiform calyx, The significance of
this diversity cannot be evaluated without much
more plentiful material,
lated to one another and, collectively, perhaps
to M. polycarpa, from which they may plausibly
by derived. Only MM. pectinaripinna was known
to Bentham, who associated it, for no obvious
reason, with the south Brazilian M. orthacantha,
a species of very different ecology that differs
materially in perfectly glabrous leaflets, long se-
tose indumentum of most stems, and in partic-
ular in the predominance of one infrapetiolar
aculeus at each cauline node.

Mimosa ctenodes is clearly and closely related
to Af. pectinatipinna, which is endemic to the
valley of rio Marafién and its western tributaries
about 130 kilometers downstream from Balsas,
but it is clearly different in leaflet-number (7-10,
not 12-25 pairs per pinna), in leaflets at once
veinless and strigulose beneath, in its almost or
completely naked (not pappiform) calyx, and in
lustrous glabrous craspedia, The species was first
collected in flower by Paul Hutchison and J. K.
Wright, in May 1964 (5434, K, NY).

In general aspect M4. rushyana is weedy and
undistinguished, but it presents to close obser-
vation a strong syndrome of specific characters:
aculei scattered alike on internodes and leaf-
stalks, a spicule between the one pair of multi-
foliolate pinnae, and a pappiform calyx. Most of
these features coincide in some populations of
the lowland macrothermic M. schrankioides, but
this differs in having less than 20, not 30-50 pairs
of leaflets per pinna. Tetrandrous mimosas sym-
patric or vicariant in sub-Andean Bolivia with
M. rusbyana are M. boliviana, M. polycarpa and
M. williamsii, The first of these differs conspic-
uously in plumose cauline setae, the second in
fewer aculei and glabrous flowers, the third in 2-
4 pairs of pinnae per leaf, and the two last further
in campanulate calyx without pappiform fringe
of cilia. The very common and polymorphic M.
xanthocentra contains forms similar to M. rus-
byana in scattered cauline aculei and pappiform
calyx, but these have 3-7 (not 1)-nerved stipules
and unarmed, espiculate leaf-stalks.
Rusby deliberately spelled the type-locality as
(cf. his Maytenus meguillensis), put
it is evidently the rio Miguilla of maps. Accord-
ing to his field-book (NY) Rusby collected at
Cahamina on August 11-14, 1921, about Espia
at the mouth of the Miguilla on August 12, and
at on August 14-16. There are at NY,
in addition to the type, two Rusby collections
(2187, 2189) lacking locality data, but very likely
from the same region, where the species was re-
collected (near Calisaya) by Krukoff in 1939 and
Chulumani and Asunto) by Stephan
Beck in 1985 (both NY).

The poorly known M. cuzcoana has all tech-
nical characters of subser. Castae and appears
only precariously distinct from M. schrankioides
var. sagotiana, which it resembles in small, gla-
brous or almost glabrous calyx, in essentially
brous stems and dark green, facially glabrous leaf-
lets, in shorter leaf-stalks, and in submontane
habitat. Mimosa insidiosa, with which Harms
considered it comparable, has retrorsely hispid
stems, continuously marginate leaflets, and is en-
demic to eastern Brazil.
The specimen from Lapanmarca in prov. La
Convencion, Soukup 817 (F!), cited in the pro-
tologue of M. cuzcoana, differs as follows: aculei
smaller (to +1 mm), accompanied by loosely
retrorse setaculei; foliage pilosulous, the lfts fine-
ly so on both faces and in addition setulose-strig-
ulose beneath; Ifts of longer pinnae 20-30-jug.,
the longer ones 9-12 x 1.5-2.5 mm, less em-
phatically venulose beneath. Iam unable to clas-
sify this collection satisfactorily.

shortly emergent bract-tips or the 4-angulate fl-
buds covered by intermeshed bracteal cilia; bracts

dorsally, distally ciliate with setulae mm;
lowers 4-merous 4-androus, some proximal! ones
staminate; calyx (described in key to vars.) either
minute membranous or paleaceous-pappiform;
corolla of Af. casta, 1.4-2.4 mm, either glabrous
or pubenulent distally; filaments white or pink,
free, exserted 6-7.5 mm. Pods commonly 3-10
per capitulum, sessile, in profile narrowly or
broadly oblong 18-40 x (6-)7-12 mm, (2-)3-4-
seeded, the very shallowly constricted replum
0.4-0.5 mm wide, contracted into an apical cusp
1.5-5 mm, hispid along back and sides with erect
stramineous brown-tipped setae or setaculei to

aculeate overall but between setae either glabrous
or densely softly puberulent, the free-falling ar-
ticles 4-8 mm long; seeds (few seen) +4 x 3.2

Mimosa schrankioides, as here interpreted, is
variable in detail, but readily distinguished in all
its forms from related M. casta and M. rusbyana
by leaflet-number alone (see foregoing key to
subser. Castae). I am uneasy about combining
in this one species forms that differ greatly in
development of floral bracts and calyx, but 44.
schrankioides sens. str. and M. sagotiana, when
defined by these characters, are no longer, as Ben-
tham thought, separable by width of pods or by
vennlation of leaflets. Davidse 13793 (NY) from
Apure, Venezuela is an example of the reduced
calyx of sagotiana coincident with the narrow
pod (+6 mm wide) of ideal schrankioides. Each
variety described herein is variable in pubes-
cence and width of pods, but due to lack of ad-
equate material the intraspecific variation of AM.
schrankioides cannot be analyzed profitably at
present.

Mimosa casta is very closely related to 4.
schrankioides, especially so to its var. sagotiana,
which has similar calyx but leaflets one third to
one half less numerous and to the same degree
Jarger, A modification in the opposite direction,
culminating in leafiets reduced to exactly two
pairs and these reciprocally dilated, would sim-
ulate M4. velloziana, which may in reality have
arisen in just this way. Although these three spe-
cies are so much alike in everything but leaf-
formula, they appear not to intergrade; I have
seen no doubtful or intermediate specimen.
In the protologue of Mf. casta Linnaeus cited
his own previous descriptions in Hortus upsa-
fensis and Hortus cliffortianus, and also Tabula
28 of the first volume of Jan Commelijn’s Horti
medici amstetodamensis. This last depicts a plant
grown at Amsterdam, from seed of unknown
provenance, that died without producing flow-
ers, but seems certainly the same as that grown
in Cliffort’s garden and the species known to Ben-
tham as M. casta. Mimosa no. 2 of Hortus clif-
Jortianus was however a mixture of AM. sensitiva
(Breynius t. 16), as recognized in Species plan-
tarum, and var. a which corresponds with Com-
melijn’s plant. In his early work Linnaeus cited
M. casta (under polynomials) from Brazil, and
his reason for changing this to India (which may
mean the West Indies) is not readily explained.
In any event, by 1753 Linnaeus must have had
another flowering plant which he mistook for M.
casta, for in Species plantarum he described the
flowers as dimorphic, some decandrous sterile,
others decandrous bisexual. The number ten is,
of course, incompatible with Af. casta, of which
all flowers are tetramerous and haplostemonous.
Iam unable to account for this discrepancy in
the protologue, but if Wijnand’s lectotypification
(as given above) is accepted, the question is ac-
ademic.
The application of the epithet casia is not ex-
plained. It should perhaps be interpreted as cog-
nate with sensitiva and pudica, the notions of
shame, sensibility and chastity being somehow
applicable to these plants, of which the leaves
shrink back in modesty when touched.

The mimosa described above is as vexatious
from a purely tactile as from a systematic view-
point. In habit, in armature, in flower and in fruit
it closely resembles M. schrankioides var.
schrankioides, but it differs from this species, and
from all other Castae, in having two pairs of
pinnae per leaf, the lower pair arising shortly
below the terminal pair but not contiguously.
The plant could be interpreted as a variety of 44.
schrankioides with anomalous foliage, but the
question of its rank must be deferred until more
can be learned about possible variation in leaf-
formula. The late Dr. Julian Steyermark ob-
served that the type-locality is in
a region rich in local endemism.
In diffuse-sarmentose growth-form and ar-
mature of seria! cat’s-claw prickles resembling
subser. Castae, but pinnae 3-S-jug. (not conju-
gate) and the pairs well spaced along a rachis
much longer than the petiole; stipu/es 1-nerved;
Ifts 8-15-jug., to mm, mostly 2-nerved; ca-
pitula axillary to coeval or immediately hyster-
anthous lvs, globose, the flowers and pods of sub-
ser. Castae.
Sp. 1, of moist montane woodland and cloud
forest in far s. Mexico (Chiapas) and w. Central
America (Guatemala, Honduras).
The single species of subser. Teledactylae re-
sembles M. casta in habit, armament and cras-
pedium, but differs gravely in leaf-formula. Spe-
cies of subser, Pudicae may have reduplicated
pinnae like M. teledactyla, but these are borne
close together toward the tip of the leaf-stalk on
a rachis much shorter than the petiole. The dis-
tantly allopatric M4. williamsii, which is com-
parable to AM. tefedactyia in habit, seria] prickles
and leaf-formula, has a strong spicule between
each pair of pinnae and is conjectured to have
arisen in somewhat parallel fashion from subser.
Polycarpae. In Central America MM. teledactyla
is morphologically isolated, and differs from the
lowland weedy Pudicae and Castae by its mon-
tane habitat.

Mimosa sensitiva is the common member of
subser. Mimosa throughout northeastern Brazil,
and readily known by the paleaceous-pappiform
calyx, brochidodrome venulation of the rela-
tively bright green leaflets, and northward from
southern Bahia notable for the spinulose-mar-
ginate bracts that form a cancellately interlocking
involucre around the flower-buds, Toward its
southern limit in Bahia and Minas Gerais the
species is, however, represented by the var. maii-
tiosa, in which the bracts are much reduced in
length and are almost or quite unappendaged,
therefore exposing the flower-buds. This var.
malitiosa suggests passage into the closely related
M. velloziana, which has similar bracts but is
nevertheless distinguished by a minute, naked or
vestigially ciliolate calyx which coincides with a
broader pod. While the faces of the pod of Af.
sensitiva are most often villosulous as well as
setose and those of Mf. velloziana are ordinarily
glabrous, this character is not as reliable as the
literature would suggest.
Mimosa sensitiva, the type of its genus, was
cultivated in northern Europe in the second half
of the XVII century, very likely introduced from
Pernambuco by Marcgrave or Piso. Its abrupt
leaf-movements made it an object of wonder at
that time, but as an exemplary sensitive it was
soon replaced by the more easily grown and pre-
cociously flowering Mf. pudica.

A weedy opportunistic mimosa, in open places
forming diffuse tangles of prickly stems but po-
tentially sarmentose through shrubs and small
trees, of dubious nativity, now interruptedly
widespread, from the lowlands to +850 m in
Mexico and to 1100 m on the Brazilian Planalto,
in tropical N. and both tropical and warm tem-
perate S. America, excluding the Antilles and
Pacific America: s. Mexico (Nayarit, perhaps
only adventive, not mapped; Oaxaca, Veracruz,
Tabasco, Chiapas) s, to Panama; trans-Andean
Colombia and Venezuela (Maracaibo and Ori-
noco basins); apparently not in the Guianas; Bra-
zil from Para s. to Parana, erratically w. to mid-
dle Amazonia, to s.-centr. Goids, and to the
Paraguai valley in Mato Grosso; seemingly dis-
junct in the lower Parana valley in Argentina
(Misiones, Corrientes) and in the Andean foot-
hills of Bolivia (Tarija) and Argentina (Salta);
collected once at Lima, Peru, presumably intro-
duced. —FI. irregularly through the year. Map 50.
Mimosa veiloziana closely resembles M. sen-
sitiva in habit, in armature of stems and leaf-
stalks, and in shape of leaflets, but differs in a
minute, non-pappiform calyx combined with a
pod ordinarily 8 or more, not 4-7, mm wide.
Populations differ in pubescence of foliage, in
length and density of setae, and puberulence of
the pod's valves; and the pod itself, like that of
M. casta, a species very similar except for a few
more pairs of leaflets, varies considerably in
width. But no correlated modes of variation are
apparent in the main east-Brazilian range of the
species. It is surmised that A. velloziana, like AZ.
Sensitiva, was originally native to eastern Brazil,
south of Amazonia, and has spread outward from
the present focus of abundance, very likely trav-
elling with livestock, the hispid pod being well
adapted to such transport. The relatively small
samples examined from the two major popula-
tions in Argentina, on the lower Parana river and
in the Andean foothills of Salta respectively, con-
firm Burkart’s discovery of different pubescence
patterns in these two disjunct regions. If, how-
ever, each derives from an independent intro-
duction from Brazil, as seems plausible, it would
not be surprising to find that slightly different
genomes, fortuitously introduced, continue to re-
produce their kind, presenting a locally uniform
phenotype.
Both Martius and Bentham assumed that the
M. viva portrayed by Vellozo was the plant com-
mon, at least formerly, within and around the
city of Rio de Janeiro, where it was collected by
most of the early botanists in Brazil, and there
is no reason to question this. Mimosa hetero-
carpa, collected by Lhotzky either in coastal Ba-
hia or in Guanabara in the early 1830’s, attained
a spurious distinctness by faulty description of
the pinnae as being four pairs per leaf, when in
fact each is merely four-foliolate. Mimosa jira-
menensis, maintained by Bentham as a variety,
exemplifies the broad extreme in fruit measure-
ment, but seems no more than this. Mimosa
maxonii represents a relatively uncommon vari-
ant with pod-valves densely puberulent.

Diffuse, potentially frutescent Aerbs, bushy
shrubs, weakly woody sarmentose vines and
(rarely) treelets, sometimes flowering when only
5 dm tall but potentially attaining m,
essentially hike Af. debilis except in the scabrous-
Strigose or glabrescent pod and prevailingly ovate-
acuminate rather than obovate lfts (but Ift-out-
line broadly randomly fallible), commonly armed
on stems and petioles with scattered recurved
aculei but sometimes erratically so and occa-
sionally unarmed, the terete or striately nerved
stems commonly at once setose or setulose and
finely puberulent but either type of trichome at
times lacking, the bicolored Ifts most often either
setose-strigose or both setose and puberulent on
both faces, frequently simply puberulent
or glabrous above and setose-strigose beneath
(the proximal Ifts sometimes more densely so
than distal ones), less often glabrous or glabrate
on both faces, always discontinuously setose-cil-
iate. Stipules erect, lanceolate 2-7(-8) mm, the
firm blade either glabrous or pubescent exter-
nally, coarsely setose-ciliate,
persistent. Leaf-stalks 1.5-6.5(-8) cm; distal pair
of lfts obliquely lance-elliptic or semi-ovate, ex-
ceptionally elliptic-obovate, from deeply semi-
cordate base, often broadest near middle and
acuminate or more abruptly acute and mucro-
nate, the larger ones 25-80(-95) x 11-27(-37)
mm, times as long as wide, the an-
terior lft of proximal pair subsymmetricaily cor-
date to lanceolate, (2-)4-12 mm; secondary
nerves from midrib either expiring or campto-
drome within the margin. Peduncles (1-)2-5 per
node, cm; capitula usually globose,
rarely ellipsoid, prior to anthesis moriform, with-
out filaments 4,5-6.5(-7) mm diam.; bracts lin-
ear-oblanceclate 0.6—2 mm, either glabrous or
puberulent dorsally, weakly or minutely ciliolate;
flowers of M. debilis, the corolla-lobes puberulent
or exceptionally glabrous except for minute gran-
ular cilia. Pods usually numerous per capitulum,
either sessile or contracted at base into a true
stipe or a stipelike neck 1-4 mm, the narrowly
oblong body (8-)13-40(-43) x 4-8 mm, (1-)2-
5(6)seeded, the replum usually scabrous with
forwardly subappressed setae less than 1 mm
(commonly less than 0.5 mm), the valves in S.
America similarly strigose and usually also pu-
berulent, the strigae sparse to densely crowded,
but the valves (in Mexico especially) sometimes
merely puberulent or even quite glabrous.
I here follow Rudd (1968) and Grether (1982)
in circumscription of M. albida, except that I
transfer var. aequatoriana Rudd to M. debilis, of
which it has the densely hispid pod. Due to lack
of fruiting material I have been unable to con-
sider M. albida var. pochutlensis R. Grether, to
which the same argument would apply in theory.
If var, aequatoriana (and presumably var. po-
chutlensis) is maintained in M. albida, the cir-
cumscription of the latter must perforce be ex-
tended to accommodate the whole set of
variations on the Sensitivae theme that I have
assembled above under the title of M. debilis.
When the spectrum of variation in habit, foliage,
pubescence and inflorescence encompassed by
M. debilis and M. aibida is reviewed, the only
practical division compatible with geographical
dispersal is that proposed herein. I suspect that
it is an artificial line arbitrarily drawn through a
single polymorphic complex. It may be said that
the leaflets of M. albida tend to be acuminate
and broadest at or shortly below mid-blade,
whereas those of M. debilis tend to be broader
distally and abruptly acute or obtuse at apex; but
there are numerous exceptions, recognized, for
example, in Grether’s description of Mexican Af.
albida. Moreover elliptic leaflets occur in both
species.
Rudd (1968), following and elaborating Rob-
inson’s (1898) revision of M. aibida, divided the
species into varieties characterized by quality and
dispersal of trichomes on leaves and pods, a prac-
tice which, if carried out evenhandedly through
Mimosa, would vastly increase the number of
infraspecific taxa without gain in exact defini-
tions. McVaugh (1987: 203) has referred to the
pubescence variants found in southwestern Mex-
ico as “hardly more than but I judge that
they can usefully be sorted into two principal
categories, corresponding with var. a/bida and
var. glabrior as defined in the varietal key that
follows, but no further divisible. Otherwise iden-
tical forms of M. albida with leaftets all setose
on both faces, all setose beneath only, or some
proximal leaflets setose but the distal ones not
so (a pubescence pattern that recurs in AZ. dedilis
and in other subseries of ser. are sym-
patric over most of the range of the species.
Grether’s map (1982: 82) vividly illustrates the
sympatry of so-called vars, strigosa and albida
in Mexico, and of vars. glabrior and euryphylla
on the Pacific slope southward from middle Sina-
loa; similarly random patterns of variation ex-
tend south along the Andes into Peru. Rudd de-
fined a var. wilidenowif endemic to northem
Venezuela by its supposedly “essentially gla-
craspedium, but the density of strigae on
the valves is in reality quite variable both inside
and outside of the variety's supposed range. The
yar. willdenowii is here reformulated to accom-
modate the Andean and Venezuelan races of A.
albida with relatively wide pod, a feature that
seems to be securely linked to dispersal.

The var. aibida is adapted to secondary hab-
itats and seeds prolifically. It appears genuinely
native in Mexico. Possibly the disjunct South
American populations descend from early intro-
ductions. Some flowering specimens from north-
ern Peru cannot be distinguished certainly from
var. wilidenowii, creating doubt about the exact
dispersal limits of the two varieties in this region.
Of the few known Bolivian records, that from
Santa Cruz (R. S, Williams 1449, NY) bears fruit
and is unequivocally var. afbida, those from
Yungas (Bang 1435 and Rusby 1297, both NY),
in flower only, may require reevaluation.

Slender macrophyllidious shrubs +1.5-3 m
with terete brown defoliate trunks paniculate or

lets either solitary or in unequal pairs, either un-
armed or erratically armed on some internodes
(and occasionally on some lf-stks) with 1-2 dis-
tantly infrastipular and occasionally also 1 re-
motely infrapetiolar, broad-based recurved acu-
fei 2-4 mm, glabrous throughout except for
setulose pulvinules and setose-marginate lfts or
sometimes thinly strigose on dorsal face of some
proximal Sfis, the olivaceous foliage either un-
changed or brunnescent when dried, subconcol-

or geminate, or paired with a floriferous branch-
let in the axil of primary cauline lvs, and ulti-
mately pseudoracemose on tenuous, shortly ex-
serted efoliate branchlets. Stipuées firm erect,
ovate or lanceolate, often obtuse, commonly 5—
ll-nerved from base, glabrous or sometimes
pectinately ciliate, the blades becoming dry stra-
mineous, persistent. Leaf-staiks of primary lvs
2.5-4.5 cm, at middle 0.4-0.8 mm diam., the
shallow open ventral sulcus bridged and mi-
nutely spiculate at apex, the lvs associated with
capitula sometimes much reduced in size; pinnae
1-jug., the rachis of each 5-12 mm, the distal
pair of Ifts much larger than the very unequal
proximal pair, one of which is often fully sup-
pressed, or at times reduced to a minute dry
blade resembling the paraphyllidia at very base
of rachis; lfts of distal pair obliquely elliptic, lance-
elliptic or semi-avate-elliptic from deeply semi-
cordate base, sharply or bluntly deltate at apex,
2.5-5.5 x 1-1.8 cm, +2.1-3.2 times as long as

ly incurved, the secondary venulation brochid-
odrome within the margin. Peduncles 6-25 mm,
capitula without filaments 4-6 mm diam., prior
to anthesis moriform or (var, urucurensis) his-
pid with emergent bracts; bracts commonly lin-
ear-elliptic 0.9-2, rarely 3-4 mm, some of the
lowest often united into an incipient involucre,
the rest linear-elliptic or subfiliform 0.2-0.3 mm
wide, minutely ciliolate, persistent; flowers
4-merous 4-androus, most or all bisexual; calyx

corolla narrowly vase-shaped, prominently
4-ribbed 2-2.8 mm, the concave ovate lobes 0.7—
0.85 x 0.5 mm, either glabrous or (rarely) pu-
berulent; filaments lilac or whitish faintly lilac-
tinged, free to base, exserted 4-6 mm. Pods 2—
several per capitulum, subsessile, in profile ob-
long 25-37 x 6-12 mm, the shallowly undulate

tiform +5 x 4.5 mm, the testa fuscous-oliva-
ceous dull,
Mimosa sensibilis resembles M. velloziana and
differs from M. debilis in the broad, weakly setose
pod, and is distinguished from M. velloziana by
truly fruticose rather than weakly frutescent,
scandent-sarmentose growth-habit and only
weakly armed or unarmed stems. Burkart (1948:
206) considered loss of the anterior proximal Jeaf-
let of each pinna to be characteristic of M. sen-
sibilis, but I find that it may be either fully sup-
pressed or represented by a minute blade
resembling the paraphyllidia at base of rachis.
Burkart (I.c.) further suggested that Af. sensibilis
might prove synonymous with Brazilian Af.
giaucescens Bentham, and has so identified (in
annotation of specimens) some Bolivian exam-
ples (e.g., Steinbach 8120, NY) that I confidently
refer to M. sensibilis. Genuine M. glaucescens
(the name is an illegitimate taxonomic synonym
of Mf. nuda var. glaberrima of this account) has
the narrow pod of M. debilis and M, nuda, and
is here equated with Burkart’s concept of 44. ob-
tusifolia. Material collected by Hassler and Fie-
brig and distributed from Geneva as Af. glau-
cescens or M, glaucescens ramosa have the
brownish-glaucescent foliage and smooth stems
of M. nuda var. glaberrima, but the shrubby stat-
ure and broad pod of M. sensibilis, of which they
appear to form a distinct geographic race, de-
scribed below as var. aguidabani. A third variety,
with emergent bracts and puberulent flowers, first
described as M. velloziana fma moorei Hoehne,
can be recognized from the middle Paraguai Val-
ley. The center of diversity for Af. sensibilis nov
appears to lie, not in the Andean foothills where
the species was first recognized, but further to
the east in the Paraguai Basin.

infra sub var. debili indicatur.
Herbs and weakly frutescent subshrubs, at first
or permanently erect, or as often diffuse or
scrambling and finally thicket-forming or sar-
mentose, at maturity commonly 8-20(-25) dm
but potentially flowering precociously and then
appearing monocarpic, rarely reported laticifer-
ous, the terete or (var. amnis-mortium) qua-
drangular stems and If-stks commonly at once
armed with scattered recurved brown-tipped
aculei 1-3.5 mm and hispid with fine yellowish
or sordid setae to mm mixed or not with
fine puberulence (but aculei, setae, and fine tri-
chomes, or some of them, not infrequently lack-
ing), the bicolored lfts brownish-olivaceous or
leaden-glaucescent above, paler beneath, either
subequally strigose-pilose on both faces, or on
dorsal face only, rarely quite glabrous, the soli-
tary or geminate, rarely globose capit-
ula forming a leafless or basally leafy-bracteate,
simple or few-branched raceme exserted +1-4
dm from foliage. Stipules lanceolate or ligulate
(2.5-)3.5-8 x 0.7-2 mm, the firm blades prom-
inently dorsally either densely
pilose, or puberulent, or glabrous, setose-ciliate,
glabrous within, persistent. Leaf-stalks (0.6-)1-
6.5(-7) cm, at middle 0.4-1.3 mm diam., 1- or
exceptionally 2-sulcate ventrally, commonly
espiculate (but spicules usual in var. amnis-mor-
tium and random elsewhere); pinnae the
rachis including pulvinus 4-20 mm, the first of
2 pairs of Ifts 0.5-2 mm distant from linear-
lanceolate or narrowly ovate paraphyllidia 1-—
2.5(-3) mm; Ifts of distal pair obliquely obovate
to oblanceolate, less often lance-elliptic, elliptic,
or ovate-acuminate (17-)20-60(-65) x
23(-30) mm, at base semicordate, at apex obtuse
mucronulate to deltate-apiculate, all palmately
3-5-nerved from pulvinule, the secondary nerves
from the variably excentric, forwardly incurved
midrib incurved-ascending nearly or quite to
margin of blade, either not or feebly brochido-
drome, the discontinuous margin with forwardly
appressed setae free for +0.6-1.5 mm, all ve-
nation prominulous and usually pallid beneath,
above scarcely raised or fully immersed. Pedun-
cles 5-20(-22) mm, capitula without filaments
mm diam., prior to anthesis either
conelike and canescently setose-pilosulous, or
moriform; bracts linear-attenuate or linear 0.6-
3.5 x 0.2-0.5(-0.6) mm, distally either glabrous
or dorsally gray-pilosulous with very slender se-
tae to 0.2—1.4 mm, densely or at least residually
setulose-ciliolate, persistent; fi-buds distally gray-
puberulent, sometimes minutely so; flowers
4-merous 4-androus, most or all bisexual; calyx
0.15-0.4 mm, the rim glabrous or minutely cil-
iolate; corolla narrowly funnelform or subtubu-
lar 2-2.6 mm, the ovate concave, scarcely thick-
ened l-nerved lobes 0.5-0.7 x 0.4-0.6 mm;
filaments lilac-, rose- or magenta-pink, free to
base, exserted 4-7.5 mm; ovary at anthesis either
glabrous or puberulent. Pods radiating in a nearly
always dense cluster, sessile, in profile oblong-
elliptic or broadly linear 10-18(-20) x 3-4.7(-
5) mm, 2-4-seeded, the scarcely constricted rep-
lum 0.3-0.6(-0.7) mm wide, at apex abruptly
short-mucronate or submuticous, except in var.
parapitiensis armed on back and sides with erect
brown- or purple-tipped, tapering setae to
(0.6-)1.5-3.5(-4) mm, the thin greenish, later
stramineous or purplish-brown and papery valves
low-colliculate over each seed and variably se-
tose or both puberulent and setose (glabrous),
when ripe breaking up into free-falling articles
3-5 mm long; seeds plumply compressed-ovoid
2.3-3.5 x 1.8-3 mm, the smooth testa fawn-
brown or fuscous, dull.
The foregoing circumscription of M. debilis
embraces all so-catled Sensitivae that have small
narrow hispid pods combined with leaflets lack-
ing the continuous rimlike marginal nerve char-
acteristic of Mf. nuda sensu lato. It is arbitrarily
distinguished from MM. a/bida by hispid, not stri-
gose pods, a feeble character of convenience that
is, however, strengthened by vicariant dispersal.
When much material of M4. debilis and nuda
is assembled, it is possible to trace a gradual
transition between a continuous and a discon-
tinuous marginal nerve, but the percentage of
ambiguous individuals is small, and where the
two species are sympatric, on and to the south
and west of the Brazilian Planalto, the distinction
is ordinarily sharp.
My definition of 4. debilis allows within the
species the same visually distracting but, on anal-
ysis, clearly random variation in armament and
hispid or puberulent vesture that occurs in M.
aibida and M. nuda, and an equivalent or even
greater range in outline, absolute size, and rela-
tive width of the terminal leaflets. The floral bracts
vary from much shorter than the flower-buds to
much longer than them, when they form a cone
in praefloration. Leaflet-outline and bract length
appear to be stabilized in parts of the whole range
of the species, but elsewhere are independently
erratic. Strictly typical M. debilis, found in low-
land savanna habitats in the Orinoco and Am-
azon basins, has ample obovate leaflets and cone-
like capitula. Morphologically similar plants
occur locally on the Brazilian Planalto, especially
around Belo Horizonte in Minas Gerais and in
the Federal District, where they are sometimes
directly sympatric with AM. nuda var. glaberrima.
A form with small oblanceolate leaflets and mo-
riform capitula, found to the exclusion of other
members of subser. Mimosa in Costa Rica, Pan-
ama, and northeastern Colombia (Meta) has been
segregated in Central America as Af. panamensis
(Benth.) Standl., and in that limited geographic
context seems distinct indeed. But entirely sim-
ilar plants are frequently encountered in eastern
Bolivia, in a region where the whole group of
Sensitivae is especially diverse and populous. At-
tempts to define these ample- and small-leaved
populations are defeated by random occurrence,
out of geographic context, of intermediate states;
moreover plants combining ample leaflets with
moriform capitula and small leaflets with cone-
like capitula are known,
It remains an open question whether morpho-
logically similar but remotely disjunct popula-
tions of Af. debilis represent independent but par-
alle] modifications, in situ, of a common ancestor,
of are genetically homogeneous and artificially
dispersed. Many of the Sersitivae are adapted to
unstable ecotonal habitats and flourish in dis-
turbed environments, They seed prolifically, and
the hispid one-seeded articles of the fruit seem
designed to promote distant zoochorous dis-
persal. It is a suspicious circumstance that the
known range on the Planalto of broad-leaved,
cone-headed var. debilis is confined to a small
segment of Sa. do Espinhago in Minas Gerais
and to the Federal District in the central high-
lands, at elevations between 900 and 1600 me-
ters. Except for Pohi 2213 (W) collected long ago
near Goids Velho there is no record known to
me for the present state of Goids, and no obvious
explanation for the failure of an often ruderal
plant to colonize more widely the ostensibly hos-
pitable cerrado province. These planaltine pop-
ulations may exemplify secondary dispersal in
M. debilis, and may eventually become more
widespread on the Planalto. Similarly the Central
American could be derived from
Bolivian parentage. But speculation on this topic
has little factual basis.
While I feel obliged to disregard some of the
more eye-catching diversity, which seems im-
pervious to organization into discrete units, I find
it convenient and probably realistic to disentan-
gle from the mass what appear to be five dis-
tinctive races of M. debilis, separable as follows:

the residue of M. debilis sensu lato after extrac-

variation in it have been discussed above under
the title of the species. Elements of the present
var. debilis were referred by Bentham (1876) to
M. rixosa, M. debilis (sens. restt.), and by Burkart
to M. rixosa and M. argentinensis, but Burkart’s

As mentioned in discussion of M4. albida, the
locally well characterized var. aequatoriana
presents the foliage of that species combined with
the pod of Af. debilis. It illustrates and empha-
sizes the over-close relationship between these
species, which are here maintained in the interest
of convenience. Mutually exclusive definition of
the pair is impossible unless var. aequatoriana
is transferred to Af. debilis, even though this tax-
onomic ruse may well not reflect its probable
origin from vicariant Af. albida.

Mimosa parapitiensis stands in relation to M.
debilis var. debilis as does typical 4. nuda to its
commoner var. glaberrima: each represents the
jast stage in a regressive sequence of indumen-
tum-losses, the stage at which even the setae of
the pod’s replum are suppressed. Since neither
of these glabrate states shows any peculiarity
linked with loss of indumentum, they are best
recognized, if at all, at varietal rank. Beyond the
protologue I have seen of var. parapitiensis only
Herzog 1176 (G) from Cumbanute. Brooke 5828
(NY) from Santa Cruz, but without exact local-
ity, closely approaches it, but cannot be posi-
tively assigned here for lack of pods. Poor spec-
imens from Yungas (Rusby 1303, NY) suggest a
small northward range-extension beyond that in-

minute puberulence (exceptionally glabrate), the
Ifis usually setose on both faces, sometimes (in

out filaments 4.5-6.5 mm diam., prior to anthe-
sis conelike, the bracts 1.5-3.5 mm, dorsally

The var. vestita has been set off from poly-
morphic var. debilis principally by the precarious
character of unarmed stems, but the growth-hab-
it, more evident in the field than in the herbar-
ium, is clearly different. Near Cuiabé I saw var.
debilis (Anderson 11343) and var. vestita (An-
derson 11346, both NY) growing together, and
at the time it did not occur to me that they could
tepresent forms of one species. Despite a distinct
growth-form, var. vestita is otherwise variable in
detail. Around the margin of the Pantanal in Bra-
zil the foliage is densely pubescent, the capitula
are silky and conelike prior to anthesis, and the
cauline setae are minutely scaberulous, In Boliv-
ia the foliage tends to be more thinly pubescent
or even glabrescent while the capitula remain
silky, but the cauline setae are often smooth. Less
than half the known specimens of var. vestita
have grown pods, and it would be premature to
claim that the long dense indumentum of the
valves will prove a constant feature of the va-
riety.

T have long hesitated over the taxonomic rank
appropriate to this strange mimosa, which is un-
like any other member of its subseries in having
square stems and triquetrous, ventrally bisulcate
leaf-stalks. In color and shape of leaflets the fo-
liage of var. amuis-mortium suggests M. yello-
ziana, but the plant is less densely prickly and
the small hispid pod is precisely that of de-
bilis. The venation of the leaflets is almost that
seen in Af. nuda var. glaberrima, but the mar-
ginal nerve is attenuated between setiform cilia
and does not form a continuous horny rim.

The complex series of forms here assembled
under the title of 4. nuda appear collectively to
represent progressive adaptations of an ancestral
resembling M. debilis to campo and
cerrado habitats on the Brazilian Planalto and in
floristically related parts of Bolivia, Paraguay and
Argentina. They exhibit modifications charac-
teristic of functionally herbaceous subshrubs
adapted to a hot dry season and intermittent
campo fires: woody roots or xylopods; stems re-
newed annually from the ground but varying in
attitude from humifuse to erect and wandlike,
but even when crowded only incipiently sar-
mentose; sclerosis of leaf-blades and stiffening of
their venation; and loss of aculei along with loss
of sarmentose growth-form. In progressive nar-
rowing of the leaflet-blades and in progressive
loss of hispid or villosulous indumentum, the
variation in Af. nuda follows paths parallel to
those described for Af. dedilis. The whole range
of leaflet shape encountered in Af. nuda as de-
fined herein is wider than in all other members
of subser. Mimosa combined and, as the pubes-
cence of leaves and pods is independently labile,
the combinations of actually-observed and po-
tential character-states are seemingly endless. One
jooks vainly for differential characters in the
flower and the pod, for these are as uniform in
size and structure as those of Af. debilis. Bentham
proposed within the megaspecies M. nuda four
specific and one varietal taxa, each of them based
on a single collection that displayed a particular
syndrome of characters in the foliage, indumen-
tum, or both. These now can be seen as random
selections from a then unforeseeable pool of mi-
nor variants.
In these circumstances exact definitions of M.
nuda and its varieties cannot be expected, and a
distinction between a glabrous “‘44.
and a pubescent “M. proposed by Bur-
kart (1948: 211, 214) for Argentina populations
of M. nuda is impossible to maintain in Paraguay
or Brazil. The key that follows makes no pro-
vision for troublesome intermediate forms al-
teady known or for others surely to be expected.
During several years of study leading to this
account of AZ. nuda I have found myself passing
from one alternative taxonomy to another with-
out finding satisfaction in any, At a time when I
was still unaware that glaucescens Bentham
was a posterior homonym, J used, in annotation
of specimens that long ago passed out of my
hands, several unpublished trinomials based on
this name,

As here envisaged, var. glaberrima is a het-
erogeneous assemblage of minor variants that I
have been unable to sort into smaller, more ex-
actly defined units credibly correlated with dis-
persal. The nucleus of the variety consists of plants
with assurgent stems and with leaflets girdled by
a strong corneous margin bearing a single file of
setae. Plants habitally similar but with weaker
leaflet-rim bearing pluriseriate setae on back and
sides pass gradually into M4. debilis. Especially in
Mato Grosso do Sul a virgately erect habit of
growth, but associated with leaflets varying from
broadly obovate to narrowly oblong-elliptic, sug-
gests passage into vars. angusta and nuda. A form
local in eastern Mato Grosso with narrowly ob-
ovate or oblance-elliptic leaflets leads into var,
angusta.

Mimosa acapuicensisis instantly distinguished
from all Mexican mimosas with the simplified
leaf-formula of subser. Mimosa by complete lack
of trichomes, the leaflet-margin being callous-
marginate but eciliate. Loss of indumentum
combined with foliage of brown-glaucescent hue
is reminiscent of Brazilian M. nuda var. nuda,
but this is a smaller, functionally herbaceous,
unarmed subshrub, has 3—5-nerved stipules, and
a sessile fruit. On account of the distinctive leaf-
formula it is convenient to associate Mf. acapul-
censis with subser. Mimosa, but ] think it ques-
tionably derived from the same immediate
lineage as M. albida and its close kindred. In
habit and coloration it appears close especially
to conjugate-pinnate forms of M. caerulea, with
which it agrees also in the nearly straight prickles.
The transition in one and the same plant between
pinnae with one and a half pairs of leaflets, the
trademark of subser. Mimosa, and pinnae with
two and a half pairs occurs in Af. goldmanii of
subser. Lactifluae, and the step to stabilization
of the lower leaflet-number seems but a small
one.

Among the all too numerous unarmed genuine
mimosas with conjugate pinnae and poorly de-
veloped calyx that pullulate in campestrian Par-
aguay AM. alleniana is easily recognized by the
coarse pallid venation of the dorsal face of leaf-
lets, and by this feature alone can be distin-
guished from unarmed forms of M. brevipetio-
data. The leaflet venation is similar in pattern,
although more emphatic, to that seen in M. pe-
dunculosa and M. feimonias, but the first of these
differs in its peculiar stature, having peduncles
nearly as long as the primary cauline axis, the
second has on the average smaller capitula, and
both have glabrate, not softly pilose, stems and
leaf-stalks. The species was named in commem-
oration of Dr. Timothy Field Allen (1837-1902),
an eminent homeopathic physician in New York
City, founding member and for many years vice-
president of the Torrey Botanical Club, and stu-
dent of Characeae, who contributed to the ex-
penses of Thomas Morong’s travel in Paraguay
in 1888-18990,

Under the specific title of Af. brevipetiolata,
originally defined as a tenuously differentiated
Microspecies narrowly endemic to Misiones, Ar-
gentina, I here assemble a series of forms hitherto
ascribed, if armed, to ser. Pudicae and, if un-
armed, either to ser. Pedunculosae, when all pe-
duncles are obviously axillary even prior to an-
thesis, or to ser. AMeticufosae, when they are at
first pseudoracemose but are subtended by a hys-
teranthous leaf. Collectively they form what Bur-
kart (1948: 188, in relation to M. oligophyila var.
pilosula) termed a nexo de unién between these
unrealistic serial categories, inherited from Ben-
tham but manifestly artificial. Characters com-
mon to all aspects of M4. brevipetioiata are two
(or weakly leaflets with essentially
simple midrib and one posterior nerve of about
the same girth, scarious elliptic floral bracts, a
minute calyx, and finely puberulent corollas. The
relatively uncommon, aculeate var. pauperoides
scarcely differs from sympatric M4. balansae ex-
cept in weaker, random prickles and in midrib
of leaflets continuously prominent dorsally. The
unarmed varieties differ from M4. afleniana in
the essentially simple, not strongly arborescent-
branched, dorsally prominent and pallid midrib
of leaflets, from the true Af. oligophyiia in short,
usually multifoliolate leaves and in initially or
at least hysteranthously leaf-subtended pedun-
cles, and from 44. petraea in much larger leaflets
and thicker capitula. The differences between va-
rieties, which are expressed in minor modifica-
tions of leaflet-number and pubescence, form a
continuum of mutually independent variables.
The range of the species as here defined is, with
the exception of poorly understood var. raja-
Siana (at 23°30'S on rio Paraguai), compressed
between 25° and 31°S in southern Paraguay and
northeastern Argentina, but it must be expected
to occur on the Brazilian side of the Uruguai
River in western Rio Grande do Sul.
For convenience of classification it seems use-
ful to distinguish these varieties of M. brevipet-
iolata:

Exactly like often sympatric var. pilosula ex-
cept for weakly aculeate nodes or internodes, the
aculei randomly distributed, sometimes absent
from some stems of an otherwise armed plant.
In habitats of var. pilosula, and sympatric with
itin the s. part of its range, from specimens known
only from between 29° and 31°S in s. Corrientes

protologue from Atlantic Rio Grande do Sul,

This erratically armed mimosa occurs in the
common range of M. brevipetiolata var. pilosula
and M. balansae, from which it may perhaps
have acquired weak prickles through introgres-
sive hybridization. Mimosa paupera, to which it
was likened by Burkart, differs not only in lack
of prickles but in retrostrigulose corollas. The
record of var. pauperoides from Porto Alegre
(Burkart, 1948: 146) was confirmed by Fortunato
(1989), who considered the taxon to be specifi-
cally distinct.

been artificially subordinated to M. balansae be-
cause of its few nodal acutei; its foliage and flow-
ers are in full agreement with drevipetiolata

considered var. rojasiana synonymous with M.

with much reduced calyx endemic to campos of
eastern Paraguay. Of the three, M. peduncutosa
is most easily recognized by its short stems, elon-
gate peduncles and relatively large capitula
(without filaments 6-7, not +4 mm diam.). Mi-
mosa leimonias and M. petraea are alike in very
small capitula but differ, possibly not specifically,
in length of leaf-stalks, leaflets and peduncles (as
given in the Latin diagnosis) and consequently
in gross aspect. The difference in leaflet-venation
described in the diagnosis may be merely a func-
tion of leaflet-size, but cannot be ignored at the
present stage of our knowledge of this intricate
group. Possibly Af. /eimonias—the epithet is the
Greek equivalent of Latin pratensis—is a lush,
herbaceous, mesophytic ecotype of the ordinarily
suffruticulose M7. petraea, which is known to oc-
cur close by in Sa. de Amambay.

Mimosa flagellaris is distinctive among humi-
fuse extratropical kindred because of ample veiny
leaftets and spiculate leaf-stalks. The latter are
comeously thickened at base, immediately above
the pulvinus, and in this feature recall the sym-
patric Af. nuda, which has leaflets similar in size
and venation, but reduced to one and a half pairs
per pinna. The pubescence of the stems and of
the corolla lobes is variable, but no correlation
with dispersal has been made out. In the sample
studied, the leaflets appear to be more numerous
by one or two pairs in Atlantic Rio Grande do
Sul, but the difference is not a decisive one. A
specimen from Paraguay (Villa Rica, Balansa
1469, G), egregious for large leaves, shows these
dimensions in excess of the figures given in the
foregoing description: leaf-stalks attaining 3 cm;
pinna-rachises 4.5-8 cm; leaflets 9-11 pairs. It
remains to be shown whether this is a casual
variant or is genetically determined. The speci-
men was annotated, apparently by Chodat &
Hassler, as a variety (unpublished) of Af. pro-
currens (i.e., of M. caaguazuénsis of this ac-
count), from which it differs, inter alia, in con-
stantly conjugate pinnae and rudimentary calyx.

This elegantly frail mimosa was described as

terete basifixed cauline setae exclude it from the
more narrowly defined subser. Obstrigosae of this

Sparsae, but M. filipetiola would be anomalous
in that company on account of its spiculate leaf-
stalks, which have led me to include it, not
without scruple, in subser. Pedunculosae. In any
context its extremely slender bifacial stems and
finely striate-nerved, basally subcordate stipules
would be a singular character-syndrome,

deciduous tropical forest along the coast as low
as 100 m, known only from the states of Jalisco

105°W).
Typical M. sicyocarpa is suggestively similar
in most respects to (subser. schran-
kioides, but lacks the close files of petiolar aculei
characteristic of that species, and I suppose its
close affinity lies with M4. caerulea. This differs
in less numerous leaflets and essentially smooth,
not densely hispid craspedia, and is of vicariant
dispersal eastward from Sa. dei Tigre in southern
Jalisco and southern Guerrero, This ideal sepa-
ration is complicated by the existence in Colima
and on the coast of southem Jalisco near Cha-
mela of plants bearing the hispid craspedia of M.
sicyocarpa but leaves with only 6-8 pairs of leaf-
lets per pinna, the largest attaining 6-11 mm in
width, Pending critical study of their status, the
characters have been omittted from the foregoing

Either armed or not, notable in the series for
reduction of feaf-formuia to i/1.5-2.5, the an-
terior lft of proximal pair suppressed, and for
peduncles all (or almost all) arising from scaly
brachyblasts, and not in terminal pseudoraceme;
larger (distal) /eaflets of typical Oaxacan var. to
+14-28 x 5-14 mm, ofan undescribed Pueblan
var, much smaller, to 7-10.5 x 3-4 mm,
In thorn forest, the typical form very local on
the Pacific slope of Istmo de Tehuantepec in s.-
e. Oaxaca, Mexico, a microphyllous var. at 1120
m ins. Puebla (Puerto del Gato, 20 mis. of Izacar
de Matamoros, Luckow 3262, NY, TEX).
When reduced to exactly six leaflets, as often
in the typical plant of the Isthmus and always
far as known) in the microphyllidious Pueb-
lan variety, the leaves of goldmanii are tech-
nically identical to those of subser. Afirzosa. The
close affinity of the species is, however, certainly
to M. factiflua and immediate kindred in south-
ern Mexico, from which it differs principally in
xerophytic modification of the inflorescence. In
organization of the inflorescence M. goldmanii
connects the core of subser, Lactifluae with the
otherwise somewhat isolated MM. xanti.

The foregoing description covers in broad, un-

countered in a taxonomically difficult group of
one or perhaps two species currently under bio-
systematic study by Grether and Chehaibar at
UAMIZ. In anticipation of their monographic
account I attempt here no more than to account
for the prolix synonymy involved in the group
and to indicate in key form one possible sorting
of these, and forebear from expressing definite
views on the taxonomic status of any compo-
nent. From superficial study of the herbarium
record four groups of forms emerge, sortable as

I refer M. incarum to subser. Lactifluae with
reluctance, its distance from the Mexican center
of the subseries being at first thought implausi-

neatly into subser. Polycarpae, but they are not.
Its technical and overall resemblance to Mf. xanti
is so close that the pair cannot be sundered.
Moreover the dry inter-Andean valleys of Peru
are known to harbor surprising disjunct races of
distantly allopatric xeromorphic and savanni-
colous species: e.g., in Caesalpiniaceae Senna

Tall, coarsely amply leafy plants, essentially
different from var. datifolia im fewer, larger (at
times much larger) feaflets attaining 2.5-8 x 1-
3.5 em.
In campo, near 700(—?) m, as presently known
of bicentric range: extratropical 8. Paulo, Brazil
(Itapetininga) s. to e. Parana (mun. Jaguariaiva
and Ponta Grossa); and at +22°30'S on the Bra-
zil-Paraguay border (Sa. de Amambay).—Fl. XII-
II-2).
Mimosa rudis and M. asperrima together ap-
pear to represent an extreme case, not yet effec-
tively stabilized, of that reciprocal adjustment
between size and number of leaflets which is one
of the principal modes of variation in polymor-
phic A4. dolens. Bentham (1876: 334) expressed
doubt as to whether M. asperrima were more
than varietally distinct from AM. rvdis, and his
suspicion has been more than confirmed by sub-
sequent collections, which forcefully suggest that
these so-called species are minor variants that
can occur in the same population. Both have
been encountered at Vila Velha in Parana: Ek-
man 16354 (8), comparable to the type of A.
rudis, and Smith & Klein 14897 (US), compa-
rable to that of Mf. asperrima; and again far dis-
tant on Sa. de Amambay in Paraguay: Rojas
10002, 10002a, 100026 (G), which Hassler de-
scribed in a hierarchy of varieties and forms (see
sypbonymy above).
Except for large size and smali number of leaf-
lets, M4. dolens var. rudis is hardly different from
var. /atifolia; except in harsh strigose-hispid in-
dumentum it resembles subsp. eriephyila. The
determinate inflorescence and the pod, first de-
scribed by Burkart (1975, are those of 4.
dolens sensu lato. Machado de Campos 158 (NY)
from Itapetininga is described as laticiferous.
As I failed to find in the Kew herbarium au-
thentic material of Af. asperrima collected by
Sello or annotated by Bentham, the holotypus of
this species may have been the specimen at Ber-
lin that survives (with a fragment at F!) in the
form of Field Museum Negative 1299.

General characters of M. dolens, and these in
particular: stems stout virgate, simple or few-
branched distally +3-6(-2) dm, densely softly
silky-lanate, especially distally, with fine flexu-
ous flagelliform setae to +3-5 mm, the lfts
ly loosely silky-pilose-strigulose on both faces;
stipules 5-11 x 1.5-2.5 mm, pubescent dorsally
like stem, glabrous within; /eaf-staiks at and above
mid-stem 0.5—1 cm; rachis of longer pinnae 7-
13 cm; Ifts 9-14-jug., the larger ones 2.5-3.5 x
0.8-1.4 cm, slenderly continuously marginate,
the comeous rim 0.1-0.15 mm wide, densely
setulose on back and sides; peduncles 5-15 mm;
capitula prior to anthesis sheathed in silky setae,
at anthesis without filaments 10-12 mm diam.;
bracts 4.5-6 mm, silky-barbate dorsally; calyx
either obsolete or to 0.2 mm, glabrous; corolla
4.5-6 mm, the lobes puberulent; capitula in fruit
2-2.5 cm diam.

Describing 44. eriophylla from flowering spec-
imens, Bentham compared it with similarly la-
nate M. pegocephaia and stated mistakenly that
the leaflets are not marginate. It has the deter-
minate inflorescence and, as we now know, the
hard hispid fruiting capitula and valvate contin-
uous pods of Af. dolens sensu lato, differing es-
sentially from virgate, amply foliate states of var,
datifolia only in the finer, denser and longer, more
silky indumentum of stems and peduncles. A
collection from between S. Paulo and Itapetinin-
ga (Martins Felipe 4, US) is ambiguously poised
between densely lanate subsp. eriophylia and the
more densely hispid states of var. latifolia. The
subsp. eriophylla varies somewhat in length of
leaf-stalks, giving rise to segregation of M. er-
iophytloides; but the latter’s var. fanosa is pre-
cisely Af. eriophylia Bentham.

In habit, inflorescence, flower, and fruit insep-
arable from MM. dolens sensu lato, but differing
from other subspp. by very numerous and
crowded lfts, in longer pinnae 33-60(-64)-jug.,
the largest 4.5-12 x 1.5-4 mm; stemis either gla-
brous or thinly setose distally; feaf-statks either
all relatively well-developed and 2-5.5 cm, or
some (many) abbreviated and 1 cm or less; lfts
facially glabrous to thinly setulose on upper face
or puberulent beneath, and the marginal nerve
either coarse (like that of subsp. rigida) and with
one row of cilia, or more slender (like that of
subsp. acerba) and with cilia along both back and
sides.
In wet campo and along margin of esteros,
local at +200-350 m on and around the Para-
guayan Plateau s.-ward from lat. 25°S, thence s.
at lower elevations to +28°S in n, Corrientes,
Argentina, e. (discontinuously, and at greater el-
evation) to e.-centr. Paran4, Brazil.—Fl. X—II
(-), the fruits maturing slowly and long persis-
tent.
While obviously distinct from other subspe-
cies of M. dolens in the many pairs of relatively
small leaflets, 14. caifosa has precisely the inflo-
rescence and infructescence of M. dolens sensu
lato. Leaflets as small and similarly veined occur
in M. dolens subsp. rigida var. deterior, so that
only a small extension of an already wide range
in leaf-formula is required to accommodate it in
M. dolens.
I feel some qualms about reducing M. setipes
to unqualified synonymy of subsp. calfosa, al-
though none as to its inclusion within M4. dolens,
for the type (Field Museum Negative /308 —the
holotype is destroyed) clearly had the character-
istic fruiting structure. Its stems appear to have
been a little more hispid distally than in other
examples of subsp. caflosa, and the leaf-stalks of
median and upper (but not the lower) leaves
shorter. The leaflets of typical ca//osa are strongly
callous-marginate (like those of subsp. rigida) and
uniserially ciliate, whereas those of M. setipes
had more slender margin setulose-ciliolate both
dorsally and laterally (like that of subsp. acerba).
It may represent a distinct variety of subsp. ca/-
fosa, or even a parailel independent modification
arisen from subsp. acerba. Modern specimens of
M. setipes, and knowledge of its distribution and
ecology, are indispensable for its systematic eval-
uation.

pid capitula (at anthesis, without filaments 8 mm
diam.), and well developed pappiform calyx
(+2.2 mm, the tube 0.8 mm, the setae to 1.4

This remarkable member of the 44. dolens ag-
gregate, first collected by Per Dusén in March
1914 (4054, MO), resembles var. do/ens in ar-
mature and viscid setulae, but the latter here can
extend over both faces of the leafiets and up
through the inflorescence. It differs more impor-
tantly in suppression of the calyx, which in var.
dolens is cither symmetrically or asymmetrically
pappiform. In lack of calyx var. pangloea resem-
bles the almost sympatric subsp. acerba var. unc-
ia. This, however, has unarmed stems, resinous
from sessile glands but not capitate-glandular,
and leaflets simply setose dorsally, glabrous
above, nowhere glandular.

Mimosa insidiosa var, insidiosa differs from
otherwise similar, at times sympatric Af. fundi-
ana by characteristic cauline pubescence of
abruptly deflexed plain setae unaccompanied by
glandular setulae. In these species the capitula
arise two or three together at most nodes of the
pseudoraceme and mature in conventional
acropetal sequence, while the fruits are typical
eraspedia, crowded into a head but not forming
a hard ball. The larger-leaved M. insidiosa var.
major, however, is very suggestive in gross facies
of Af. dolens sensu lato, but differs from typical
var, dolens in lack of aculei or glandular setulae,
from its var. rigida in pubescent leaflets and much
smaller capitula, and from the whole species do-
fens in organization of the inflorescence, which
lacks a larger terminal capitulum. The two va-
rieties of Af. insidiosa described by Bentham ap-
pear strongly characterized, but I have seen no
modem collection of var. major and its pod is
unknown, The degree of its relationship to Af.
insidiosa var. insidiosa is consequently very un-
certain.

Mimosa oblonga is closely related to the ex-
tensively sympatric Af. ramosissima, which is
similar in growth-habit, foliage, and ecology, but
is instantly separable by the relatively large firm
4-ribbed calyx with incurved deltate teeth, and
less certainly by perfectly globose rather than el-
lipsoid capitula. As defined by the foregoing de-
scription Af. oblonga is polymorphic in small
differences of pubescence, armature, size of ca-
pitula, and length of floral bracts, but as some of
this variation appears to be well correlated with
dispersal it is possible to recognize two varieties.

Flowers of the type, and of plants collected
since in Minas Gerais and Parana, have retro-
strigulose corollas, but on Sa. da Bocaina in S.
Paulo the hairs of the corolla lobes are antrorse,
and those of the corolla-tube are retrorse. Most
examples of var. oblonga from Minas Gerais and
S. Paulo have very short bracts and relatively
long calyx (+0.4-0.5 mm), in contrast to longer,
often emergent bracts and very small calyx (0.2-
0.3 mm) prevalent in Parana. The racial situation
needs close study in the field, The single collec-
tion of var, obfonga known to me from Sta. Cat-
arina (mun. Joagaba w. of Cacador, Smith & Reitz

From what can be made out from the clear
Field Museum photograph of the destroyed type,
supplemented by Bentham’s description of it, it
appears that the long-obscure Mf. orthacantha
was based on an esetose example of the species
subsequently described by Hoehne as M. botu-
catuana. Except for its hispid indumentum the
latter agrees in every observable detail with M.
orthacantha, and most strikingly so in the form
of the ascending infrapetiolar spurlike aculei. The
hispid bristles of Af. botucatuana are seen in
modern collections from Parana to be variable
in length and density between branches of one
collection, and Hatschbach 14506 (NY) includes
one branch completely shor of setae. Therefore
setose Af. botucatuana and esetose M. orthacan-
tha are interpreted here as random variants of
one species.

In the context of unijugate haplostemonous
Mimosa of extratropical Brazil Af. serra is in-
stantly distinguished by sharply 3-4-angled
prickly stems, broad, striately venulose stipules,
and exserted pseudoracemes. It appears to have
no really close relatives, but is technically similar
to M. lundiana, M. trichocephaia and M. pusil-
ticeps. Burkart mentioned as comparable M. in-
sidiosa and M. lundiana (as insidiosoides). The
first differs in retrorsely setose stems, the second
in partly glandular indumentum, and both in 3—
5 (not 12-25)-nerved stipules. The species was
collected first, near Guarapuava, by Erik Ekman
(S, sub 44, acutangula, nom. nud.!).

seen three surviving dupticates of this, all of which
differ from 4M. sparsiformis in smaller simpler
leaves and, in particular, in one-nerved leaflets
girdled by a simple continuous pailid margin be-
reft of cilia. As already known to Burkart, M.
Sparsiformis occurs in armed and unarmed states,
which perhaps deserve some taxonomic recog-

Mimosa gymnas, so named for the hairless
stems and leaflet margins, is akin to the more
northern M. monticoia, but a coarser plant, gla-
brous except for a few retrorse setae on peduncles
alone, with longer leaf-stalks and larger leaflets
(see key for measurements). It differs from MM.
glabra, which is known at present only from Rio
Grande do Sul, in weak or suppressed armament,
leaves larger in all parts with leaflets of longer
pinnae 10-18 (not 8-10)-jugate and not nerve-
marginate, and most decisively in the conven-
tionally articulate fruit. Mimosa sparsa is obvi-
ously different in leaf-stalks only 2-4 mm and
pinnae less than 1 cm long.

The pod of Mf. glabra resembles, on a small
scale, that of several members of sect. Habbasia
ser. Pachycarpae, but is smooth and glabrous. So
far as known all other Sparsae bear conventional
craspedia, and valvately dehiscent fruits are
known from extratropical Brazil only in sect. Ba-
tocaulon sex. Stipellares and sect. Calothamnos.
Mimosa glabra is consequently isolated in the
genus and here associated with ser. Sparsae on
the basis of vegetative and floral resemblances.

Mimosa prionopus is distinguished by this
strong of characters: bluntly four-an-
gled stems thinly retrostrigose with basifixed (ba-
sally ecalcarate) setae; incrassate stipules and
paraphyllidia; bread, dorsiventrally compressed
petioles densely retrociliate along each margin;
pallid-marginate and antrorsely setose leaflets of
thick texture (recalling those of Af. dolens subsp.
rigiday, glabrous flowers; and paleaceous calyx.
In the stipules and paraphyllidia it resembles Af.
pseudocallosa, but this is a smaller, more slender
plant with terete stems and a simply lobed mem-
branous calyx. The petiole of M. pseudocaliosa
is somewhat laterally dilated distally. but lacks
the dense fringe of stiffly deflexed, pluriseriate
setae which has suggested the epithet prionopus
(Gr. prion, saw + pous, foot or foot-stalk). The
paleaceous calyx with dissected lobes is unique
in subser. Sparsae, most of which, furthermore,
have stems either armed, or terete, or both,
The collector described the stems as reaching
1.5 meters in length, but they are scarcely 3 dm

Mimosa pseudocatiosa is strongly differenti-
ated by lack of prickles, extremely reduced in-
dumentum, and dilated venulose paraphyllidia.
Burkart associated it with members of subser.
Reptantes of this revision, from which it differs
technically by (inter alia) glabrous, not retrostrig-
ulose corollas. In habit it recalls the ecologically
comparable M. diffusa, but is of coarser growth,
and differs in stipules, in foliose paraphyllidia,
and deeply campanulate calyx. The epithet
pseudocatiosa draws attention to an odd simi-
larity in foliage to some members of subser. Do-
dentes, but these are very different in form of
inflorescence, At first I piaced Af. pseudocallosa
only provisionally and with misgiving in subser.
Sparsae, noting that its systematic position would
need reassessment when the fruit became known,
but the discovery in 1990 of Mf. prionapus has
provided a plausible connection to subser. Spar-
sae. Its low stature and simply toothed, not pa-
leaceous and fimbriate calyx separate it deci-
sively, however, from prionopus.

The subseries Obstrigosae is here limited to
those true mimosas that bear on their stems and
peduncles characteristic cuneiform or scalelike,
retrorsely appressed setae coincident with con-
tinuously marginate leaflets. The nucleus of the
subseries consists of the five species with sub-
sessile leaves described by Bentham in Flora
brasiliensis (1876: 266, key). To these Burkart
added M. ourobrancoénsis, a tropical-montane
analogue of warm-temperate Af. rupestris, M. ob-
strigosa, and the far-southern Af. tandilensis, all
essentially very similar; and the peculiar M. ram-
Soi, remarkable for solitary, immediately infra-
petiolar aculei, for yellowish retrorse setae con-
centrated near stem-nodes and under the capitula,
and for a relatively dense dusty-gray indumen-
tum of loose reflexed hairs. Mimosa glabra and
M. sparsa, classed by Bentham with these typical
Obstrigosae, are here referred to the new subser.
Sparsae, in which the retrorse setae, when pres-
ent, are terete and basifixed, and coincide with
discontinuously marginate leaflets. Mimosa gla-
éra was from the first anomalous in ser. Odstri-
gosae for want of retrorse setae that constituted
the signature of the series itself, and was extraor-
dinary in that context for its turgid, valvately
dehiscent fruit girdled by a broad replum remi-
niscent, on a small scale, of diplostemonous ser.
Pachycarpae. Mimosa sparsa has retrosetose pe-
duncles, but the setae are terete and basifixed,
and the close affinity of the species appears to lie
with M4. sparsiformis, M. monticola, and M. at-
a group with which Bentham was un-
acquainted. In the event M. sparsa is retained in
subser. Obstrigosae, this subseries cannot be de-
tached by any formal criterion from subser.
Sparsae.
While 44. ramboi and M. sprengelii are clearly
marked and relatively isolated taxa, the remain-
ing Obstrigosae are intimately related and in need
of critical scrutiny, especially in the field. The
characters of mature stature, leafiet-number, de-
velopment of prickles, and length of peduncles
that have been found serviceable in combination
to distinguish between species are all individu-
ally unstable. Revisionary study will probably
reduce the number (or at least in some cases the
tank) of those recognized herein.

Mimosa ourobrancoénsis was collected in early
days on Mt. Itatiaia by Claussen, perhaps also
in unknown localities by Sello, and again near
Onro Branco in 1884 and 1888 by Glaziou, but
the specimens were referred by Bentham (Claus-
sen 39, K! = NY Neg. /842, plant at left, and
perhaps also Se/lo s.n., at right) and by Glaziou
(1906, Lc.) to Mf. rupestris, a smaller plant of
extratropical dispersal that differs in fewer pairs
of 2-3 (not leaflets and puberulent
flowers. Burkart did not mention Af. rupestris in
the protologue of Af, ourobrancoénsis, merely re-
marking that it differed from all other Obstri-
gosae in habit alone, Within its range of dispersal
M. ourobrancoénsis is readily recognized by its
spindling growth-habit consisting of long slender
leafless trunk surmounted by a few stiffly as-
cending microphyllous new branches, by the
dense thatch of retrorse, basally spurred, scale-
like setae that covers the young stems and pe-
duncles, and by the single pair of relatively long
and narrow, multifoliolate pinnae.
An unnumbered Sello collection at K (divided
between hb, Benth, and hb. Hook,), distributed
from Berlin as M. rupestris but not so annotated
by Bentham, differs slightly from typical M4. ou-
robrancoénsis in narrow one-nerved stipules, but
has the glabrous flowers and narrow bracts, with
the many one-nerved leaflets, of the species, and
is provisionally referred here. Its provenance, like
that of so many Sello collections, is unknown.

Herbarium specimens of M4. rupestris and M.
ourobrancoensis are readily confused, the dense
retrorse cauline indumentum and the small im-
bricate leaflets being much alike, and the differ-
ences in stature and habit not evident. In Flora
brasiliensis Bentham cited the early collections
of M. ourobrancoénsis as M. rupestris, but the
morphological differences in habit, in venation
of the leaflets, and in pubescence of the corolla,
strengthened by widely allopatric ranges of dis-
persal, adequately distinguish them. The type of
M. subinermis, which Bentham himself even-
tually treated as a taxonomically negligible armed
variant of Af. rupestris, is the only specimen of
its sort known to me, Except for its very few
aculei, inserted on one infrastipular rib imme-
diately below random nodes, it appears identical
with genuine M. rupestris. Nothing exact is known
of its origin or dispersal, and its status remains
contingent on rediscovery.

This account of MM. tandilensis is based largely
on the careful and comprehensive studies of Bur-
kart, cited above. I remain sceptical, however,
as to whether 44. tandilensis is specifically dis-
tinct from the certainly very closely related AZ.
ramulosa, of which Burkart had no distinct
knowledge. The fatter is described as an erect,
stiffly and flexuously branched shrub attaining
two meters in height, whereas M. tandilensis nor-
mally has humifuse or diffusely trailing stems less
than one meter long (exceptionally erect when
sheltered), In leaf-formula, leaflet-venation,
flower, and fruit the two species are essentially
identical. The nature of the relationship can be
determined by field-study.

The exemplary descriptions, figures and com-
mentary on M. adpressa given by Burkart (1948,
1987, ll.cc.) are definitive. The identity of Af.
denhardtii could not be confirmed from isotypic
material, but seems certain from Bailey’s de-
scription and from the fact that Af. adpressa has
been long known in cultivation in California.

On open stony hillsides, at elevations not re-
corded, known only from Uruguay. Records from
tropical southeastern Brazil (Glaziou, 1906, l.c.,
discussed below) are based on faulty data.—F1.
VI, XI-I(-?), the full cycle not known.
At anthesis Mf. sprengelii resembles MM. ra-
mulosa in most respects, but differs in the sub-
sessile or very shortly pedunculate capitula. Care
must be taken to distinguish true peduncles from
occasional axillary branchlets which may lose
their leaves at the fruiting stage and simulate
elongate peduncles, The fruit of sprengelit
appears different from that of all other Obstri-
gosae in valvate dehiscence and coarse hispid
indumentum of the pod-valves.
The type of Kurt Sprengel’s Afirnosa ciliata
has not been located, and was perhaps lost at
Berlin, where much of his herbarium was housed.
A Sello specimen emphatically annotated by
Bentham (in his own herbarium at Kew) is pro-
posed as neotype in the nomenclatural paragraph
above. This plant agrees well with the proto-
logue, except that it has slightly more numerous
leaflets, but it cannot be known for certain wheth-
er it is in fact an isotype or part of a second
collection of the species.
Two specimens were cited and distributed by
Glaziou as M/, ciliata: his 19134, vaguely indi-
cated as from the state of S. Paulo, Brazil, which
is misidentified ramuiosa (q.v.), and his
19133, which is correctly identified but was sup-
posedly collected on Alto Macahé in Serra dos
Orgios in Rio de Janeiro, Wurdack (Taxon 19:
911. 1970) has demonstrated that two Afelas-
tomataceae labelled by Glaziou as coming from
Alto Macahé were in fact collected elsewhere by
Puiggari and De Moura, and has raised suspi-
cions of deliberate fraud on Giaziou's part, A
strange detail of Glaziou 19133 (P!) is that the
specimen is accompanied by a typical field-label
in Glaziou’s hand, dated 8 August 1888, and a
ticket bearing the same number /9/33 is at-
tached to the plant. Thus all data seem coherent
and authentic. Two alternative explanations are
possible: a) there really is (or was) a disjunct
population of M. sprengelii, otherwise collected
only in Uruguay, or of a cryptically similar rel-
ative, on the summit ridge of Alto Macahé; or
b) the record was deliberately falsified. The prob-
ability that a local Uruguayan species occurs dis-
junetly on the Organ Mountains is low, but the
truth of the matter can only be ascertained by
careful fieldwork. The idea that Glaziou obtained
the specimens from a correspondent and man-
ufactured a false statement of provenance seems
preposterous, but Glaziou’s field-note of fleurs
jaunes, which would be an anomaly in ser. Ob-
Strigosae, also requires explanation or confir-
mation. For the present it seems best to consider
M. sprengelii endemic to Urguay.

Mimosa pudica, the mimosa best known, al-
though not exceptional, for its shrinking response
to shock or touch, is closely related to Mf. poly-
dactyla. From this it differs most obviously in
simpler leaf-formula, but also (cf. key to subser.
Pudicae) in broader stipules and Songer fila-
ments. In some respects it is a variable species,
but the task of disentangling the intraspecific tax-
onomy is lightened by the worldwide revision by
Brenan (1955, condensed in 1959: 46), whe pro-
posed a lectotype and recognized within the spe-
cies three varieties distinguished by characters

On streambanks, along ditches, in disturbed
or waste places and in pastures, mostly below
250 m, but as a weed ascending to 1000 m or
more, widespread and locally abundant around

tiphery of Gulf of Mexico, and s. to scattered

Tt seems likely, but not demonstrable from hard
evidence, that an earlier name for var. unijuga
is M. pudica glabrata DeCandolie, Predr,
2: 426. 1825, based on Affmosa hurnilis, frutes-
cens et spinosa, siliguis conglobatis Phumier ex
Burman, Pl. amer. fase, 9: t. 202. 1759, ‘tin ins.
Sancti-Domingi et Sancti-Thomasii,’’—All
modem collections from Hispaniola that I have
seen represent var. wnijuga, the dominant form
of the species throughout the Antilles, as do all
the five known collections from St. Thomas.
However, Plumier's plate, at least in Burman’s
reproduction, lacks the fine detail on which va-
identity hinges, and I therefore follow
Brenan in discarding var. glabrata as ambiguous.

Over much of the range of AM. pudica sensu
lato the valves of the pod are glabrous. Locally
in northern Roraima, Brazil the faces of the pod
are puberulent and sometimes also finely thinly
setulose. The extreme variant here described as
var, pastoris (in memory of the discoverer, Fa-
ther Wilson-Brown) has the indumentum of the
pod much augmented and simultaneously has
lost all cauline aculei. More collections are need-
ed to demonstrate the constancy of these char-
acters.

The type of andreana, a truncated stem in
young flower, is unusual in having three pairs of
pinnae in all leaves that were collected. Similar
leaves are known occasionally in the variety (e.g.,
Croat 18010, NY), but I have seen no other ex-
ample of uniformly trijugate pinnae. Britton and
Killip keyed Af. andreana among ‘woody spe-
cies,’ but there is nothing in the type-specimen
to suggest a habit more fruticose than adult A.

Mimosa polydactyia is evidently most closely
related to Af. pudica, which it resembles in its
weedy, weakly suffrutescent habit of growth, in
subpalmately pinnate leaves, in relatively simple
leaflet-venation, and in much reduced calyx, all
advanced characters in the genus. The differences
between them in leaf-formula, while usually in-
stantly apparent in mature specimens, are not
individually absolute. Some leaves of each may
have just three pairs of pinnae, and some pinnae
of each may have about thirty pairs of leaflets.
However, when pinnae of most leaves are three
pairs the leaflet-number is decisive and when
leaflet-number is ambiguous the number of
pinnae is decisive. Only quite immature or in-
complete specimens present any problems in
identification. Mimosa verecunda, similar in leaf-
formula, has pinnae more openly spaced along
the upper leaf-stalk in most leaves, but is most
teliably distinguished by the paleaceous-pappi-
form calyx, and most readily so by allopatric
(upland planaltine) distribution.

Mimosa huberi is sympatric with the phase of
M. (subser. Hirsutae) hirsutissima that has passed
in Venezuela as M. tomentosa H. & B, ex Willd.,
and has been confused with it in herbaria. It is
a more robust and more erect plant, with pal-
matipinnate leaves and more numerous, more
simply veined leaflets, and differs further in cau-
line vesture of scaberulous setae and in smaller
pappiform, not paleaceous calyx. In habit and
foliage it recalls Brazilian 44. vestiza, but this has
smaller leaves, smooth setae, and paleaceous ca-
lyx.
The species is dedicated with gratitude to Dr.
Otto Huber of Caracas, whose collections from
Venezuelan Guayana have enormously enriched
the herbarium of New York Botanical Garden.

Mimosa guaviarensis appears closely related
to M. pudica, to which Killip referred the type-
collection, but it differs in stiffly virgate growth-
habit, and especially in the small, shortly peti-
olate leaves crowded along the stem. Cuatrecasas
recorded the plant as frutex, but did not note its
stature. The specimens suggest a suffruticose
wandlike mimosa of a type common in campo
and cerrado habitats south of Amazonia. No Co-
lombian mimosa at all closely resembles it.

Because of the two to five pairs of pinnae in
each major cauline leaf, Mf. verecunda was aligned
by Bentham (1875: 397) in ser. Pudicae next fol-
lowing polydactyia, but its really close kin-
ship, if this can be inferred from similarity in
leaflets, inflorescence, calyx, and craspedium, is
with conjugately pinnate xanthocentra. Like
the latter, Af. verecunda occurs in armed and (less
common) unarmed states, and is similarly vari-
able in indumentum, the type specimens, for ex-
ample, having hispid stems but most modern
examples strigose ones. In its upland planaltine
range of dispersal M. verecunda differs in number
of pinnae from all sympatric eu-mimosas other
than Afm. pudica, hirsutissima, rufipila, macro-
cephaia, procurrens, and plurijugate forms of M.
distans, but it exceeds all these in number of
leaflets (38-90 pairs in longer pinnae), and differs
further either in narrower leaflets, or in structure
of the calyx, or in both at once.

of apically villosulous flowers, the same deeply
dissected or fringed calyx, the same leaflet-ve-
nation reduced to a simple, subcentric midrib
raised only on the dorsal face, and the same pod
except insofar as this varies in hispid armament
or pubescence of valves and replum. The acu-
leate series corresponds with Af. xanthocentra s.
str., 44, polycarpa sensu Bentham (but not of
Kunth), M. stenoptera Bentham as extended by
Burkart, and the insubstantial mtansii Mar-
tius, The unarmed series consists of M. subseri-
cea Bentham, MM. stipularis Bentham, Af. gova-
zensis Bentham, Af. tremuda Bentham, and M.
fongepetiolata Malme, an intergradient set of
forms distinguished only with difficulty by stat-
ure, indumentum, width of stipules and leaflets,
and girth of capitula. In this enlarged sense AZ.
xanthocenira embraces elements of Bentham’s
series Meticulosae and Pectinaiae, which had been
artificially separated by emphasis on aculei and
on strength or continuity of the leaflet’s marginal
nerve.
Armed and unarmed forms of M. xanthocen-
tra exhibit the somewhat unusual concentric pat-
terns of dispersal inexactly dupticated by the dip-
lostemonous AZ. somnians (q.v.). The unarmed
forms of the species are widespread almost
throughout the basins of the Paraguai and Parana
basins upstream from their confluence, but ex-
tend outward only feebly, northward into the
Tocantins and Araguaia valleys and eastward into
the upper S. Francisco basin in Minas Gerais.
Aculeate plants are sympatric with unarmed ones
over much of this range, but are most abundant
around its northern, eastern and western periph-
ery and extend far beyond it into northwestern
Argentina, in Brazil to Maranhao, Piaui, central
Minas Gerais and the Organ Mountains of Rio
de Janeiro, and reappear on savannas of the Ori-
noco and Maracaibo basins in Colombia and
Venezuela. Interpretation of this pat-
tern hinges on the primitive or derived nature of
aculei in this group. The prevalence of prickles
in disparate species-groups of haplostemonous
Mimosa suggests that epidermal armament dates
back to an early stage of differentiation in the
genus. If this is so, unarmed A4. xanthocentra
subsp. sudsericea and subsp. tremula are spe-
cialized derivatives of armed precursors, which
they have replaced or threaten to replace over
much of the Brazilian Planalto. The alternative
interpretation requires independent acquisition
of aculei in Sa. do Espinhago, the Andean foot-
hills, and north of the Amazonian Hylaea.
Further variation in foliage and indumentum
is discussed under individual taxa.

Mimosa mansii combines in one plant the habit

ular aculei of Af. xanthocentra and forms an in-
dissoluble bond between these conceptual taxa,
heretofore segregated into different series by the
criterion of armament. Burkart recognized that
the so-called fma acerosa, despite its small in-
frastipular aculei, could not be specifically di-
vorced from M. subsericea, but he did not pursue
the logical projection of this insight into the tax-
onomy of sect. Afimosa.

This is an ambiguous mimosa, resembling var.
xanthocentra in every respect except that it is
unarmed. Malme described it as shrubby and
attaining a height of two to four meters, a stature
that is quite unusual in Af, xanthocentra, but I
can find no difference in indumentum, flower-
structure, or pod. In addition to the type-collec-
tion, in which pinnae of larger leaves bear about
forty pairs of leaflets to 10-19 mm long, Malme
secured also on the Chapada a similarly long-
petiolate plant (Ma/me 11/3347, S) with twice as
many leaflets about half as large, but seemingly
not otherwise different. Furthermore, he en-
countered in the same vicinity plants (Malme If/
33274, G, 5; Malme s.n., 2,VI. and 6.VL1930,
with aculeate stems that cannot be distin-
guished technically from some populations of ex-
tra-Brazilian var. xanthocentra. These plants ex-
hibit in a suggestive way a variation in leaflets
parallel to that just described for unarmed var.
longepetiolata, one (6.VI) having about 40 pairs
of large leaflets, the other to 105 pairs about half
as long. It may be that var. /ongepetiolata is no
more than a tall unarmed minor variant of var.
xanthocentra, but the situation requires closer
observation in the field, In any event I feel con-
fident that Af. fongepetiolata is properly to be
contained in the broad concept of M. xantho-
centra.

Two mutually independent modes of variation
contribute to the more conspicuous variation
within what is here defined as var. subsericea:
quality of pubescence, and width of leaflets, the
latter closely related to distance between succes-
sive pairs but not to their number nor, conse-
quently, to length of pinnae. Nomenclaturally
typical subsericea has narrow crowded leaflets
silvery-silky beneath, whereas MM. stiptdaris is
based on a variant in which stipules broader than
customary (but not unique) in M. xanthocentra
sensu lato coincide with broader, more distant,
but equally pilose-silky leaflets. Bentham early
suggested that 44. stipularis might represent no
more than an extreme form of M. subsericea, and
his suspicion is confirmed by the number of in-
termediate forms now extant in collections.
Moreover, there are parallel series of thinly stri-
gose green plants with broader and narrower leaf-
lets which, if Af. stipudaris is recognized at any
level, command the same attention. It is worth
noting, however, that no one variant of var. sub-
sericea occurs universally through the variety's
range and some variants appear, on present ev-
idence, to be relatively localized—for example,
plants truly equivalent in all respects to M. stip-
ularis are known only from southern and eastern
Mato Grosso—the overall picture being one of
genetic drift and incipient differentiation related
to dispersal.
Of the variants described by Chodat & Hassler
only var. strigosa is anything out of the ordinary
in var. subsericea; it has relatively few and broad
leaflets which simulate those of sympatric 4.
polycarpa vat. spegazzinii. I suspect that var. stri-
gosa and its aculeate analogue var. strigoso-acu-
deata, herein referred to var. mansii, are hybrid
derivatives from a cross between some unarmed
form of M. xanthocentra and armed Af. poly-
carpa spegazzinit. The type of each variety, how-
ever, has the ellipsoid capitula and pilosulous
flowers of Af. xanthocentra sensu lato.

The types of Af. goyazensis and M. tremula
are in my eyes narrowly conspecific, but the names
as applied by Bentham in Flora brasiliensis (1876)
stand for distinct taxa: goyazensis being the
equivalent of the present var. tremula, and M.
tremula of the present var. fers. In combining
the two names, I would have preferred to adopt
the epithet goyazensis and synonymize M. tre-
mula, which Bentham misunderstood. When
united at the varietal level, however, a ghostly
var, tremula, autonymously generated by var.
tenuis Bentham in 1841, takes precedence over
any usage of goyazensis that might be proposed
at the varietal level.

ing by virtue of crowded, retrorsely imbricate,
very narrow pinnae, hispid stems, and small,
ventrally glabrous leaflets, but the individual
flower and pod differ not at all from those of M4.
xanthocentra sensu lato, It seems possible that
the population of var. tenuis in the two, mutually
distant districts from which samples are at hand
are independently derived, for they are different
im minor points: at Xavantina the cauline setae
are about 1.5-2 mm long and the pairs of leaflets
on longer pinnae are 32-42; in Minas Gerais and
S. Paulo the setae rise to 2.5-5 mm in length
while leaftet-pairs are not over 20-32. It seems
geographically probable that Sello’s plant was of
the latter sort. In 1830 Sello took the road from
Mogi das Cruces in S. Paulo east to Itajuba in
Minas Gerais (cf. Urban, 1906: 110), passing di-
rectly through the known southern range of var.
tenuis.
Ihave refrained deliberately from neotypifying
var. fenuis, for a duplicate of the type may yet
be found among unnumbered Sello collections
in some European herbarium,

It is not disputed that Mf. centurionis is related
to M. morongii, to which (under the taxonomic
synonym M. argillicola) Hassler subordinated it,
but it differs in so many details as to deserve
specific status. Lack of aculei, coarser foliage,
leaflets mostly 5 (not 3)-nerved, much longer pe-
duncles and fatter capitula contribute to a de-
cidedly different facies. In unarmed, procumbent
stems and in spathiform calyx AM. centurionis
resembles also M. caaguazuénsis, but differs in
pinnae exactly two (not mostly three) pairs per
leaf, in much smaller leaflets (to 6-9, not 11-32
mm long), in ellipsoid (not globose) capitula, and
in free (not monadelphous) stamens.
In addition to Fiebrig's collections cited in the
protologue of M. argillicola subsp. major I have
seen anly one later collection, T. Rajas 3045 (M)

An inconspicuous little mimosa, differing from
starveling forms of M. pudica principally in the

the plants are characteristically armed at nodes
with 1-3 aculei, but I have seen one unarmed
plant (Quinta Fiebrig, 1941, Chodat s.n., ex parte,
G) which suggests relationship to the also Para-
guayan M. lupinoides. The latter, however, has
erect stems, much larger leaves and leaflets, and
larger globose capitula. Other species technically
similar, such as M. hirsutissima or M. digitata,
have symmetrically paleaceous calyx and either
much larger or much more numerous leaflets.

Mimosa bipennatula might be visualized as a
decidedly fruticose yet very slender, short-leaved
form of the common A. xanthocentra var. sub-
sericea, but may be distinguished by the elegantly
striate stipules, the short pinnae, and the contin-
uously marginate leaflets. The forms of var. sub-
sericea known to occut on Chapada dos Gui-
mariaes have, in addition, much larger leaflets.
The close affinity of Af. bipennatula is with M.
jacobita, found in similar rupestral habitat at the
western edge of the Parana basin in Bolivia.

This little crooked shrublet has foliage of the

fruiting characters. In ecology and in extremely
narrow, marginate leaflets stacked contiguously

Mimosa disperma is clearly and closely related
to Mexican M. affinis, from which it differs not
at all in leaf or individual flowers, but appears
nevertheless distinct in lack of aculei, in small
ovate, minutely ciliolate interfloral bracts, and
in pod hispid overall with long stramineous se-
tae. In the event that these characters prove vari-
able, as is not unlikely, Mf. disperma may turn
out to be a vicariant variety of Af. affinis, from
which it appears at present to be detached by a
distance of at least 2000 km and 19 degrees of
longitude.

I am acquainted with 44. niomartei only
through specimens (Nunes, EAC /1431) kindly
provided by its describer, Prof. Fernandes, In the
protologue it was compared with M. rixosa of
subser. Afimosa, but the few-flowered capitula
of small ascending flowers are characteristic of
subser. Affines and the plant as a whole closely
resembles at nearly all points the Mexican A/.
tequilana. In addition to the weak differential
characters noted in the key to the subseries, A/.
niomariei appears to be a somewhat taller plant,
at first sight suggesting a broad-leaflet form of
M. debilis. Despite the immense distance be-
tween their ranges, I am not altogether confident
that M. tequilana and M. niomarlei are specifi-
cally distinct.
In the protologue the epithet is spelled, at the
beginning of the description, nomariei, but else-
where, as on herbarium labels provided by Prof.
Fernandes, as niomariei, adopted herein.

ciliolate; corolla glabrous; filaments obscurely
united only below the ovary; pods many, in-
curved into a spherical head, 3—-4-seeded, densely
hispid along the slender replum, craspedially de-
hiscent.
Sp. 1, of lowland savanna (llano) in e. Colom-
bia and perhaps n.-e. Bolivia.
The syndrome of simple virgate stem arising
from an annual root, deciduous 1-nerved stip-
ules, conjugate pinnae, a minute, weakly ciliolate
calyx, and numerous craspedia of each fertile
capitulum incurved into a bristly ball effectively
excludes M. simplicissima from any group hith-
erta formulated within ser. Adimosa. Its leaves
are most nearly comparable with those of con-
jugate-pinnate forms of Mf. pudica var. unijuga
or of M. schrankioides, but it differs from both
in duration of the root, in deciduous stipules,
and in incurved pod, and further from M.
schrankioides in armament of the stem. From
the annual but diffusely branched and thus hab-
itally different subser. Affines it differs in the very
numerous flowers packed into a globose head,
not relatively few and all ascending from the re-
ceptacle. Rare forms of M. hirsutissima in which
hispid stems coincide with one pinna-pair in all
leaves differ from M. simplicissima in elongate
peduncles arising from diffuse stems and woody
root, dorsally venulose leaflets, and a paleaceous
calyx. In all these more or less closely interrelated
mimosas the pods, whether few or many to the
capitulum, are straight, when many radiating
from the receptacle and not incurved on one an-
other into a hispid ball.

brous facially but sometimes setulose dorsally or
finely puberulent on both faces, always setose-
ciliate, the solitary or exceptionally geminate pe-
duncles axillary either to contemporary or to hys-
teranthous lvs, or a few of the furthest shortly
pseudoracemose. Stipules firm erect, linear-lan-
ceolate 3-7 x 0.4-0.9 mm, dorsally either dense-
ly setose or only puberulent, becoming dry and
then fragile, deciduous. Leaf-statks of lvs below
mid-stem 1-9 mm, of upper lvs 0-5 mm; pinnae

neath weakly (2-)3-4-nerved from pulvinule, the
straight simple midrib dividing blade 1:1.5-4,

mm, the testa smooth but scarcely lustrous, ei-
ther light brown or fuscous.
The racially complex Af. is closely
related to M. venatorum, M. papposa and M.
pyrenea, all of which have similar marginate leaf-
lets, paleaceous calyx, and filaments monade!-
phous around the ovary, and is weakly distin-
guished by mostly axillary, rather than
pseudoracemose, capitula, all or nearly all the
peduncles being subtended at or immediately fol-
lowing anthesis of the capitulum by fully ex-
panded leaves. Each variety, however, differs
from each of the kindred species in other tech-
nical characters, and each has, so far as now
known, its own area of dispersal. The var. Ay-
poglauca, confined to the highlands of southern
Bahia and northern Minas Gerais east of rio S.
Francisco, has no close relative in its range. The
transfranciscan varieties are vicariant with A.
venatorum, but differ from it in leaflet-number
(+20-50, not 50-95 pairs in longer leaves),

Mimosa calocephala is very closely related to
M. Aypoglauca sensu lato, and when better known
may perhaps be viewed as a series of large-flow-
ered, therefore fat-headed forms or varieties of
that species, culminating in the extremely
flowered var. pohiii. The firm glaucescent, cor-
neously marginate leaflets and dense consistency
of the capitula at anthesis recall some unarmed
forms of M. do/ens, but the large paleaceous ca-
lyx, the monadelphous filaments, and the acro-
petal maturation of the capitula argue against
close relationship in that direction. Moreover the
eraspedium is that of ser. Polycephalae.

Virgately erect or stiffly assurgent subshrubs 1-
2m, with mostly simple, sometimes distally few-
branched stems densely clothed from base to
middle or beyond with close-set sessile lvs, thence
passing upward into a few-branched efoliate pan-
icle of pseudoracemose globose capitula rising
2.5-6(-7.5) dm above foliage, the stems and if-
stks strigose with appressed or hispid with erect,
smooth or microscopically scaberulous setae to
(0.S-)1-3 mm, the axes of inflorescence more
softly and densely pilose with flagelliform setae,
the firm plane pallid-marginate, usually facially
glabrous but rarely silky-strigulose, always se-
tose-ciliate dull purplish-brown overlaid with
dove-gray glaucous bloom. Stipules often decid-
uous before maturity of associate lf, consequent-
ly little known, the few seen firm, narrowly lan-
ceolate 4-7 x 0.4—0.8 mm, setose dorsally. Leaves
all sessile against the stem or a few of the lowest
raised on a petiole less than 5 mm; pinnae
the rachis of longer ones 5—1 1(-14) cm, the longer
interfoliolar segments 1-4.5(—5) mm; lfts of lon-

pearing contiguous or narrowly imbricate and
sessile against rachis on very short pulvinule, the
anterior one of first pair much smaller than its

oblong from obliquely obtusangulate or rarely
subdilated base, at apex obtuse apiculate or acute,
straight or obscurely falcate, the larger ones (5-)7-
12 x (1.3-)1.7-4,5(-5) mm, +3-5(—5.5) times as
long as wide, commonly 6-7-nerved from pul-
vinule, the midrib displaced to divide blade 1:2-
3, the single anterior nerve and two inner pos-
terior ones produced nearly to blade apex, the
outer posterior ones shorter, a weak secondary

prominulous dorsally, obscure or fully immersed

lobes (0.7-)0.8-1.1 x 0,.5-0.6 mm; filaments pink
fading whitish, at base monadelphous through

three per capitulum, often solitary, potentially
3-seeded but often only L ovule fertile, the sessile
body plano-compressed, in profile 10-15 x 6-
7.5 mm, the replum 0.4-0.6 mm wide, constrict-
ed between seeds, the papery, pale brown valves
mm thick at middle of each article, a little
thicker at margins and at isthmi, at once densely
puberulent and thinly strigose-hispid with for-
wardly appressed or loosely ascending setae to
+1-1.5 mm, when ripe separating from replum
and breaking up into broadly elliptic free-falling
lentiform articles 8-10 mm long; seeds plumply
discoid, in broad view round-elliptic 5.5 x 4-5
mm, the testa dull brown, fuscous within the
pleurogram.
Astriking mimosa, notable for tall virgate stems
and for the metallic dove-gray bloom of mature
leaves, which densely clothe the stem up to an
exserted panicle of small capituia, but which tend
to disjoint in the dry season. Lacking the fmuit,
Bentham misplaced M. taxifolia among Metic-
ulosae with valvately dehiscent pods, The close
relationship is now perceived to be with AZ. radu-
fa, which may have quite similar growth-habit
and is scarcely different in flower-structure or
craspedium, and has similar scaberulous setae.
The leaflets of Ad. raduia are, however, for the
most part at once broader and more emphatically
inequilateral. The known range of M. radula lies
to the east and south of that of polycephala
var. taxifolia, except that both are known to oc-
eur near Itiquira in northeast Mato Grosso do
Sul. In this station M. raduda is represented by
its var. calycina, which differs greatly from var.
taxifolia in lower leaves at once petiolate and
extremely ample.
As AM. polycephaia has become better known,
the claim of M. taxifolia Bentham to indepen-
dent specific rank has faded. Bentham contrasted
the 15-20 pairs of facially glabrous leaflets found
in the type of M. taxifolia with 30-40 pairs of
appressed-villosulous leaflets in that of Af. poly-
cephala. We now have examples of as many as
42 pairs of leaflets in Af. taxifolia and one, col-
lected in the type-locality by Riedel, has leaflets
scabrous-strigulose facially. The type-collection
of M. polycephaia differs, so far as it goes, from
M. taxifolia, in very slightly more numerous but
also more crowded leaflets almost veintess on
both faces, although the same pattern of vena-
tion, embedded in the epidermis, is perceptible
externally. The flowers, and the fruits which were
unknown to Bentham (the young fruit of Af. poly-
cephala described in Flora brasiliensis is from a
galled flower), have turned out to be essentially
identical. I take them to represent vicariant va-
rieties.
The mutually distant origins of A/. taxifolia
and M. polycephata were both misunderstood by
Bentham. Riedel’s Sa. da Chapada is in southern
Mato Grosso, not in Minas Gerais, and Gard-
ner’s Rio Preto is in northwest Bahia, not in
Pernambuco, Nevertheless, there remains to this
day a gap of some 700 km between the eastern
known limit of Mf. polycephaia var. taxifolia sens.
str. in the Araguaia valley in Mato Grosso and
the narrow dispersal-range of var. polycephaia in
southern Piaui and northwestern Bahia. The spe-
cies should obviously be sought in the Tocantins
valley in northern Goias.

and M. densa, each group having a member en-
demic to or represented on Chapada dos Vea-
deiros, Sa. dos Pireneus, and Sa. dos Cristais, is-
lands of arenitic caprock rising from an ocean of
cerrado. Each group consists presumably of relic
expressions of a homogeneous, widespread type,
their insular nature having encouraged genetic
drift and the fixation of a new specific identity.
Mimosa papposa differs from its two closest rel-
atives, M4. pyrenea and M. venatorum, in fewer
leaflets (in larger leaves less, not more than fifty
pairs), further from M4. pyrenea in longer, less
crowded leaflets, and in completely leafless pseu-
doracemes; and further from M. venatorum in
abbreviated leaf-stalk in all leaves, pinnae only
half as long, and glaucescent leaflets almost
nerveless dorsally. The less closely related A.
Aypoglauca, allopatric to the north and east, dif-
fers in mostly foliate pseudoracemes and leaflets
essentially 2-, not 3-6-nerved from pulvinule. So
far as known today AM. papposa is of sparing
occurrence on the headwaters of rio Maranhao

alike densely silky-pilose with forwardly ascend-

1.5-2.5 mm, the valves at length separating into
free-falling articles, seeds not seen.
This as yet incompletely known mimosa is dis-
tinguished among relatives with long paleaceous
calyx and filaments connate around the ovary by
the great length of the pinna-rachises, relatively
large coarse leaflets, short pseudoracemose or
corymbiform inflorescence, and especially by se-
tae scabrous-ramulose at base, the slender ones
that clothe each face of the leaflets appearing
proximally stellate, Its nearest sympatric ally, Mf.
polycephala var. taxifolia, differs in its effuse py-
ramidal inflorescence of many capitula rising far
above the foliage and in leaflets glabrous except
for setae. Allopatric Af. venatorum and
M. papposa have smaller, narrower leaflets, and
M. petiolaris, with which Malme compared M4.
callithrix in the protologue, seems yet further
Temoved by its few-leaved stems, long slender
petioles, facially glabrous leaflets, and virgate
efotiate pseudoraceme.
T have seen in addition to the type of M. cal-
lithrix only two approximate topotypes (Afori
16763, 16807, NY) and the specimens cited in
synonymy under M. dammeriana Glaziou, nom.
nud. The latter was recorded in Glaziou’s Liste
from Minas Gerais, but the attribution is almost
certainly incorrect. The piece of Glaziou 19136
in the Paris museum lacks the dated hand-writ-
ten field-label that commonly accompanies a
specimen collected by Glaziou himself, and
moreover consists of decapitated fowering stems
quite uncharacteristic of Glaziou's usually care-
ful and complete preparations. It is likely that
the collection was acquired by Glaziou from a
perhaps amateur collector and originated, not as
the label would have it from a Mato Grosso in
Minas Gerais, but from the state of Mato Grosso.
So closely does Giaziou 19136 resemble the type
of Af. callithrix in every detail that I suspect it
may also have been collected on Chapada dos
Guimaries.

Mimosa thermarum resembles M. radula, and
especially its var. imbricata, in virgate habit and
paleaceous calyx, but differs in more numerous
and smaller, essentially veinless leaflets, and in
its indumentum of subplumose setae. The in-
dumentum suggests kinship to M. danuginosa, a
member of ser. Polycephalae which is unmistak-
ably different in 3-11 (not 26-35) pairs of larger,
dorsally 3-5-nerved leaflets. The coincidence of
plumose setae and virgate life-form suggests kin-
ship to M, diversipiia, remotely allopatric in Par-
aguay and northeastern Argentina, but this dif-
fers fundamentally in its obsolete calyx and is
referred herein to a different subseries.

convex valves densely silky-pilose overall with
loosely ascending subfiliform cream-colored silky
setae to 3 mm, when ripe separating from rep-

seeds not seen well-preserved,
Mimosa lanuginosa is visually and tactually
notable for the soft silky or plushlike, pallid in-
dumentum that clothes the stems and leaves, a
vesture unique in ser, Polycephaiae. It is closely
related, nevertheless, to vicariant M. raduéa and
its sympatric vars. intbricata and radulina, with
which it shares a wandlike, densely foliate stem
and the paleaceous calyx of the series. When Bur-
kart described M. /anuginosa as a member of ser.
Lepidotae (sec. Calothamnos of this revision) he
admitted that its genetic affinity lay in the direc-
tion of ser. ‘Meticulosae,’ from which it was tech-
nically excluded by the character of arborescent
hairs and by lack of a strong marginal nerve on
the leaflets. This nerve, however, is in effect pres-
ent, though not very pronounced and concealed
by dense pubescence. Burkart noted that some
hairs of M. radula bear toward the
base small emergent cells that prefigure the ar-
borescent ramification seen in Af. /anuginosa,
and the difference is more in degree than in kind.
Similar scaberulous hairs are now known ta ac-
cur in several related taxa of ser. Polycephalae,
and seem clearly homologous with branched hairs
of M. fanuginosa. It is high time to abandon a
typological concept which subverts classification
according to genetic affinity, This has become
more urgent and inevitable with the discovery
of M. danuginosa var. raduliformis, in which the
arborescent trichomes of M. fanuginosa are as-
sociated with the leaf-formula and spiciform in-
florescence of M. raduia, and of a second species
of this series, M. thermarum, also pubescent with
branched hairs,
Typical M. lanuginosa resembles M. radula
var. imbricata in having all leaves sessile against
the stern, but it has only 4-5 (not 7-16) pairs of
leaflets in longer pinnae, The poorly documented
var. raduliformis resembles in leaf-formula and
some distinctly petiolate lower leaves the rela-
tively scarce M. radula var. radula.

tae to 1-3 mm, the ripe valves separating from
replum and breaking up into free-falling, indi-
vidually indehiscent articles 4-5 mm long; ripe
seeds not seen.
Mimosa radula may be recognized by this syn-
drome of characters: multifoliate virgate stems,
mostly one meter tall or more, passing upward
into an efoliate pseudoraceme or few-branched
panicle; cauline indumentum composed of setae
either perfectly smooth or scaberulous, but not
arborescently plumose; leaflets relatively few (4—
20 pairs) per pinna and relatively ample (some
over 1 cm long); and the paleaceous calyx and
monadelphous filaments of its series. Native to
small portions of its extensive planaltine range
of dispersal are M, virgula, almost a microphyl-
lidious version of it, which has leaflets of much
the same number but much less than one cen-
timeter long; and the habitally similar Af. ther-
marum and M. lanuginosa, which differ in ar-
borescently plumose cauline setae. The virgate
growth-habit and leaf-formula of M. radula are
deceptively repeated, at the eastern margins of
the Brazilian Planalto, by members of ser. Brevi-
Bedes, but these have very small or obsolete, non-
paleaceous calyx and free filaments.
In 1875-1876 Bentham had seen ten miscel-
laneous examples of the species here described
as MZ. raduia sensu lato, and interpreted them as
representing three distinct but related species,
one of them with a variety, of which the critical
features were length of petioles, number and size
of leaflets, and length of peduncles. With the ad-
vantage of eight times as many collections, and
consequently a much more accurate notion of
the dispersal of individual variations and the
constancy of correlations between them, the
modem student cannot accept M. radula, M. ca-
M. imbricata and its var. muiltijuga, and
M., dimidiata at the rank to which Bentham as-
signed them. The characters emphasized by Ben-
tham have turned out to be independently vari-
able, leaflet-size and -number are less exact than
could be predicted a century ago, and some sup-
posed discontinuities have been filled in by in-
termediate states then not known. In place of
Bentham’s five taxa I find it possible to recognize
herein five varieties of one species M. radula,
three of them incorporating all Bentham’s ma-
terial, and two newly described.

sens. str. by Bentham (1876: 297) in his key to
the Meticulosae with paleaceous calyx were de-
veloped leaf-stalks, relatively few and large leaf-
lets, and subsessile capitula. These characters are
now known not to form a stabilized syndrome:
plants having the foliage of A4. radula (and in-
cidentally its scaberulous setae) can have pedun-
culate capitula and others, referable to M4. caly-
cina by leaflet-size and -number, may have
petioles well developed in lower leaves and sub-
sessile capitula, The var. radufa now emerges as
one extreme of a nearly continuous spectrum of
variation, and cannot be specifically detached
from the commoner vars. calycina and imbri-
cata.

In the light of collections that have accumu-
lated since Bentham's monograph. Af raduia var.
calycina is seen ta combine the stalked lower
leaves of var. with leaflet-number of var.
imbricata. It differs further from var. radua in
relatively smooth cauline setae and in smaller
leafiets of most upper leaves, the size inversely
correlated with number; but from var. imbricata
it differs essentially only in well-petiolate lower
leaves. Small differences in ciliation of the ieaf-
lets and number of their primary nerves noted
in Bentham’s key no longer seem taxonomically
significant. The type of Ad. dimidiata had rela-
tively narrow leaflets and is perhaps intermediate
to var, imbricata,

semitonsa. It differs from var. in soft pi-
Jose cauline indumentum of almost smooth se-
tae, and in materially shorter pinna-rachises. The
combination of short pinnae and few large leaf-

Being locally common in the cerrado of the
Federal District and a tall, conspicuous wandlike
plant impossible to overlook, var. imbricata is
the most frequently collected and consequently
the best known variety of Af. raduda. Leaves all
sessile against the stem and leaflets at once rel-
atively small (none over 2 cm long) and pubes-
cent on upper face are the only discriminatory
features that now seem to detach it from the rest
of Af. radula, The var. semitansa, with almost
the same number and size of leaflets, has lower
leaves petiolate and the leaflets themselves are
glabrous above, while the other varieties have
either fewer leaflets, or much larger leaflets, and
when their leaf-formula is similar have obviously
stalked lower leaves.

Mimosa virguia has the wandlike habit of
closely related but more widespread and allo-
patric M. radula var. imbricata, and essentially
the same flowers and fruits. It is notably distinct,
however, in the diminished foliage composed of
sessile pinnae not more than 2 cm and
less than 6 mm long. It appears to be a special-
ized, microphyllous derivative of M, radula sen-
su lato.
Although described here for the first time, M.
virguia was first discovered in the year 1819 by
A. de Saint-Hilaire. A small specimen of it col-
lected by W. J. Burchell nine years later was mis-
taken by Bentham for the sympatric M. pyrenea.
It was next seen in 1894 by A.-F.-M. Glaziou,
who recognized it as undescribed, but provided
no more than an illegitimate name. In modern
times it has been collected repeatedly by H. S.
Irwin, W. R. Anderson, J. M. Pires and others
and, while narrowly restricted in range and hab-
itat, is said to be locally frequent.

Mimosa pseudoradula resembles the closely
related Af. radula in all details of flower and ped,
as well as in outline and venation of the relatively
ample leaflets, but differs greatly in habit ofgrowth
and disposition of the foliage. Whereas the stem
of M. radula is densely clothed up to the inflo-
rescence with mostly sessile leaves, M4. pseudo-
radula has only a few subradical long-petiolate
leaves clustered on the xylopodium or at very
base of stem; or has at best 1-5 distant, smaller
and more shortly, but still evidently petiolate
cauline leaves borne at distant nodes below mid-
dle of the plant, most of which consists of a vir-
gate or narrowly paniculate inflorescence bare of
leaves. The two species next following, Af, flavo-
caesia and M. cyclophylla, are similar in habit
but differ much in details of foliage.
The plentiful modem collections of M. pseu-
doradula fail into well-differentiated pubescence-
types, here recognized as varieties. That most
prevalent in Distrito Federal, particularly on the
Sobradinho and Torto forks of rio S. Bartolo-
meu, has almost glabrous or puberulent and sca-
berulous stems often but not always bearing a
few cauline leaves, and leaflets margined with a
single file of forwardly appressed setae, Outside
the Distrito this form, which is described below
as var. detonsa, is known from only one collec-
tion on the upper Parand near Alianga.
Less common in the Distrito, but occasionally
sympatric there with var, detonsa, is var. pseu-
doradula, distinguished by long-setose lower stem
and leaf-stalks and by elongate setae spreading
at wide angles from the leaflet-margin. This ex-
tends further outside the Distrito than var. de-
tonsa, south-westward to the Descoberto valley
and north to Chapada dos Veadeiros and Ni-
quelandia in central Goias. Its range contains and
greatly exceeds that of var. detonsa. On Serra dos
Cristais in southwestern Goids Af. pseudoradula
is represented by a population similar to var.
detonsa in indumentum of lower stem and leaf-
let-margin but differing in leaves more definitely
radical, shorter, and composed of one or two less.
pairs of leaflets in each pinna. This differs further
from var. detonsa in having the setae of the pri-
mary inflorescence-axis sharply retrorse and is
thereby easily separated as an endemic var. crys-
tallites. An intermediate type, having the retrorse
indumentum of inflorescence and shortly peti-
olate leaves of var. crystallites but the leaflet-
number of var. detonsa, is known from two col-
lections to the west of the Distrito and is with
some misgiving described as a distinct taxon,
var. anapolitana.

Mimosa flavocaesia resembles M, cyclophylla
in growth-form, in thick-textured corneously
marginate, relatively ample leaflets, and in pa-
leaceous calyx and monadelphous stamens, and
is clearly a close relative. It differs, however, in
lesser stature, in stems foliate about to middle
and not only radically, and particularly in the
obliquely or dimidiately ovate (not suborbicu-
lar), rather smaller leaflets ciliate with emergent
cilia. The visually striking contrast between yel-
lowish-setose margin and glaucescent faces of the
leaflets suggested the epithet.

cyclophylia is distinguished from related wand-
like, basally foliate congeners of the central Goias
highlands by large suborbicular-ovate leaflets of
thick texture, girdled by a strong, almost or quite

Mimosa uniceps, a clearly specialized species
ofcampo rupestre, forms dense clumps of foliage
rising about 10 cm above soil-level from a
branched subterranean caudex. In its dwarf stat-
ure and monocephalous stems it stands apart
from all other Polycephaiae except the scapose
M. pumilio of Chapada dos Veadeiros in Goias.
The small pod with, when two-seeded, valves
that fall from the replum in one piece is atypical
of Polycephalae, The species may be related to
M. hirsutissima rather than to the core of subser.
Polycephailae, but has unarmed stems and con-
jugate pinnae that only exceptionally coincide in
M. hirsutissima and then in diffuse plants with
stems several times longer and much longer ax-
illary peduncles. Fresh flowers are required to
determine the form of the androecium.

Bentham referred this notably distinct scapose
mimosa to what now appears to be an arbitrarily
defined and unnatural ser. Pedunculosae, placing
it between Af, elongata, which is strongly cau-
lescent and has several pairs of pinnae per leaf
and retrostrigulose flowers, and the humifuse Af.
Slagellaris, both of which have minute, not pa-
leaceous calyces. Mimosa fongipes is obviously
out of place in this company. Its stiff, horny-
marginate leaflets and paleaceous calyx, how-
ever, suggest genetic affinity to Af. pseudoradula,
M. cyclophylia and M. flavocaesia, species of the
same general region, none of which were known
in Bentham’s lifetime. In this group it stands
alone, except for its diminutive sibling A4. pumi-
io, by virtue of subradica] leaves and scapiform
peduncles nearly as long as or longer than the
leaves,

An elegant little mimosa, notable for radical
leaves and slender scapose peduncles, in habit
not far removed from the related M. petiolaris,
but diminished in all parts. The discovery of
4-merous and 6-merous flowers in one head was
unexpected, but the materia! is too scanty to al-
low further dissections, and the composition of
the capitula remains uncertain. The species was
first collected by Ernst Ule in September 1892
at “Morro do Salto na regifio do Tocantins su-
(762, R!), doubtless close to the type-
locality.

The description of M. setifera has been com-
piled from the protologue, the cited type-pho-
tograph, and direct observations of fragments at
the Field Museum consisting of a leaf and flow-
ers. The specimens collected by Pilger were trun-
cated stems perhaps 5 dm long, and suggest a
plant similar in habit and. stature to M. venato-
rum or M. xanthocentra var. subsericea. The leaf-
lets resemble those of var. sudsericea in shape
and venation, but the paleaceous calyx and mon-
adeiphous filaments are in closer agreement with
set, Polycephalae. More complete material and
the fruits ace required to round out the descrip-
tion. From present evidence, however, M. seti-
Jera appears materially different from any mi-
mosa yet characterized.

This easily recognized but somewhat poly-
morphic species was separated by Bentham into
an aculeate 14. nervosa referred, despite the ex-
istence of unarmed varieties, to the armed ser.
Pudicae, and a little group of unarmed but oth-
erwise similar species (A4m. hirsutissima, hirsuta
and barbigera) which formed the nucleus of un-
armed ser. Hirsutae. The random and erratic de-
velopment of aculei at different nodes of one
stem, on different stems of one plant, and from
one to another population of like plants growing
under similar ecological conditions, make seg-
regation along these lines impossible to main-
tain. Members of the unarmed group were sup-
posed by Bentham to differ in pubescence, length
of leafstalk, and number of pinnae, but these
features are now known to vary independently,
and the definition of infraspecific categories has
become ever more elusive as comparative ma-
teria] has accumulated. With some misgiving I
here propose to recognize two main series of
forms, one more or less glabrous, but each vari-
able in length of cauline setae, in development
of aculei, and in size of leaflets; and beyond these
a pubescent variety endemic to the Tocantins—
So Francisco watershed in western Bahia and
adjoining Goiads, in which the leaf-formula is
somewhat modified. The more pubescent var.
hirsutissima is very widely but discontinuously
dispersed from the Orinoco valley south to Par-
aguay and, in Brazil, to S. Paulo, whereas the
presumably derived, glabrate var. barbigera is
confined to middle and high elevations of the
Brazilian Planalto.
As redefined herein, Mf. Airsutissima differs
when armed from Af. pudica in the paleaceous
calyx. When unarmed and with more than one
pair of pinnae per leaf it resembles Af. procurrens,
but this, like 14, pudica, has a minute calyx. When
unarmed but with all pinnae conjugate, its pa-
leaceous calyx combined with axillary peduncles
is characteristic; whereas when armed and with
all pinnae conjugate it is infallibly distinguished
by relatively wide, mostly S—6-nerved leaflets.

sion from) M. flageilaris. Most populations of
M. hirsutissima with normally 2-3 -jugate pinnae
in at least some upper leaves have leaflets not
more than 11 mm long or 3 mm wide. In north-
central Minas Gerais (Irwin 23004, 23681,
the largest leaflets attain 17 x 4-5 mm, dimen-
sions approached, however by the type of M4.

The nomenclaturaily typical populations of var.
barbigera from east-central Goias have relatively
short stems (to +6 dm), either ascending or per-
haps (as Bentham thought) erect. Also in central
Goias and exclusively further west in Mato Gros-
so the variety is represented by a humifuse form
with erratically radicant stems, encountered in
brejo or swampy grassland (Anderson 11337, Ir-
win 16631, NY), and interpreted as an ecotype,
In northern Minas Gerais is found a robust form
with leaflets attaining 10-21 x 3-6 mm (irwin
23795, 23878, 27108, NY). In an early stage of
this revision I annotated some of these as un-
published varieties of AZ. nervosa.

Mimosa pogonoctada, which is known to me
from only one collection besides the type, can be
visualized as a small-leaved, unarmed version of
M. hirsutissima, which it closely resembles in
leafiet-venation and floral morphology. Its leaves
are rather smaller than those of M. hirsutissima,
and composed of up to four pairs of pinnae which
are not crowded near tip of leaf-stalk, thereby
imparting a certain individuality of facies. Judg-
ment as to its independent specific status must
be suspended until more can be learned of its
habits and potential variability. In general aspect
it simulates 47, distans var. elongata, but its co-
rolla-lobes lack the silvery retrorse indumentum
characteristic of subser. Reptantes.

The poorly known A. vestita has the leaf-for-
mula, leafiet-venation and paleaceous calyx of
M. hirsutissima, but is unarmed (so far as known)
and differs conspicuously in the virgate habit of
growth, the stem being densely foliate below the
middle and the inflorescence thence far exserted
and In habit, paleaceous calyx, and cal-
lous corolla-lobes it is compatible with the large
planaltine group of species allied to M. radula,
but these have leaves stabilized at exactly one
pair of pinnae. The combination of characters
displayed by M. vestita is a puzzling one, but on
balance the similarities with the Hirsutae appear
stronger and may indicate the real relationship
of the species.

Mimosa digitata and M. rufipila have nearly
the same planaltine range and many morpho-
logical features in common, so are not readily
distinguished at first sight. From modern collec-
tions by Heringer and Irwin it has been learned
that while the stems of M4. digitata are nearly
always aculeate, those of Mf. rufipila are only ex-
ceptionally and randomly so. The leaf-formula
is nearly the same in both, but pinnae and leaflets
of 44. digitata are shorter and its more crowded
leaflets are only weakly 2—3 (not dor-
sally, with simple (not branched) midrib. The
calyx of M. digitata is symmetrically pappiform
and its corolla-lobes are corneously thickened
and strongly involute even in praefloration,
whereas the calyx of M. rufipila is asymmetrical
and the corolla-lobes are membranous and only
shallowly concave. In the callous and involute
corolla-lobes, and consequently 4-sulcate flower-
buds, M. digitata resembles the also sympatric
M. vestita, but this is more easily distinguished
by relatively few and larger leaflets and by the
virgately exserted pseudoraceme of capituia.

Beatham considered macrocephaia distinct
from other members of his ser. Hirsutae because
of its ellipsoid rather than subspherical capitula,
but it is now known that other so-called Hirsuzae,
including the very closely related M4. procurrens,
may have flower-heads longer than wide. Afi-
mosa procurrens and M. macrocephata are alike
in indumentum, foliage, corolla and craspedium,
the most immediately striking difference being
in habit of growth, the former having pliantly
humifuse stems whereas the latter is erect. Closer
scrutiny reveals that the calyx of Mf. macroceph-
ala is better developed on the flower’s posterior
side, where it is plainly paleaceous, whereas the
equivalent lobe in M. procurrens may be reduced
to a few random setae. Both species are known
to occur in Goids on upper forks of rio Corumba
in the foothills of Sa. dos Pirineus, but M. macro-
cephala extends northward from there to the
sources of rio Maranhao and MM. procurrens east-
ward into Distrito Federal. They are not known
to occur in direct association where their ranges
overlap and they appear to be sibling species,
doubtless differentiated from a common progen-
itor but now effectively vicariant in dispersal.
Fieldwork is required to determine whether the
separation is as abrupt as it now appears.

Mimosa procurrens, which was known to Ben-
tham through one sample onty, is now well docu-
mented by ten modern collections, all from the
headwaters of the Corumbé river in southeastern
Goias and the southwestern quarter of the Fed-
eral District. Its evidently close relationship to
M. macrocephaia is discussed under that species
(p. 700). Records of procurrens from Argen-
tina are based on material of the less closely re-
lated M. caaguazuénsis, which see for comment.

Mimosa lupinoides is related on the one hand
to Af. monadelpha and on the other to M. caa-
guazuénsis, for comments on the differential
characters see these kindred species. Hassler’s
formae of /upinoides appear inconsequential
in the light of subsequent collections, and his
subordination of the species to Mf. nervosa ill-
advised. The form of M, Airsutissima that im-
pinges on the range of M4. iupinoides is handily
distinguished by humifuse stems and much

Mimosa caaguazuénsis is closely related to M.
lupinoides, which it resembles in stature, in pin-
hae crowded at tip of leaf-stalk, and in mem-
branous spathiform calyx, but it is plainly dif-
ferent in the stiff setose pubescence and much
larger leaflets, all facially glabrous except for ran-
dom setulae on back of some proximal ones.
Hassler encountered both species at Caaguazu,
where the ranges overlap, and distin-
guished them in the field, naming AM. iupinoides
correctly and referring (in adnotation, G) his ma-
teria] of M. caaguazuénsis 10 a variety of M.
nervosa. Burkart later described and illustrated
the species with characteristic precision, but per-
petuated Micheli’s misidentification of the first
collection, Balansa 1833, as M. procurrens Ben-
tham. Genuine Af. procurrens, known to Burkart
only through Field Museum Negative 1360, is
now well documented by long series of modem
collections from localities all concentrated in the
basin of upper rio Corumba im south-central
Goias and adjoining Distrito Federal, Brazil. It
differs from Mf. caaguazueénsis particularly in leaf-
lets nearly twice as many per pinna, in asym-
metrically pappiform (not membranous-spatha-
ceous) calyx, and in facially glabrous (not densely
retro-scabrous) craspedium.

Mimosa brevipes resembies some members of
ser. Polycephatae in virgate, multifoliate and far
exserted, sometimes spiciform, efoliate pseudo-
racemes, but has a minute non-paleaceous calyx
and filaments free almost or quite to base. In
habit it resembles some forms of M. dolens sensu
lato, which may have similar calyx but differ in
the determinate inflorescence. The species stands
as a convenient prototype of its series, a group
of microspecies highly diversified on Sa. de
Amambay, along the Brazil-Paraguay border, and
for short distances to the west and cast of this
divide. The species is dismayingly variable in
length and density of setae on stems, on back of
pinna-rachises, and on pod-valves, in absolute
and relative width of leaflets, in length of floral
bracts, and in diameter of the capitula. Speci-
mens from Sa. de Amambay (Hassler 11209, G,
NY, distributed as sp. nov., but not described)
have loosely setose stems and comosely setose
pods, to 12-16 pairs of leaflets to about 2-2.5
mm wide, and capitula without filaments 5.5-7
mm diam. A collection from municipio Sidro-
landia in Mato Grosso do Sul (Hatschbach 26056,
NY) has, like the type from nearby Rio Pardo,
subappressed-setose stem and pod, to 16-24 pairs
of leaflets only 1-1.5 mm wide, and moriform
capitula only 4-5 mm diam. These extreme types
are linked, however, by intermediate forms in
which characters of indumentum, leafiets, bracts
and capitula vary independently.
Perhaps owing, at least in part, to Bentham's
misconception that Riedel’s Rio Pardo was in
Minas Gerais, and not the river of that name in
the present Mato Grosso do Sul that flows into
the Parana close to 22°S, M. brevipes has been
cloaked in obscurity since its discovery. Early
Paraguayan collections of it were misidentified
by Chodat and Hassler either as MJ. setistipula
1462 from Villarrica, G) or M. erio-
phylla (Hassler 5826 from rio Carimbatay, G),
or thought to represent a new taxon (Hassler
11209 from Sa. de Amambay, cited above under
M. vernonioides, nom. nud.).

testa fawn or fuscous, dull.
Mimosa diversipila is poised morphologically
between two extensive complexes, that of Mf. do-
dens, for the most part similar in subobsolete
calyx but dissimilar in the precocious terminal
capitulum, and that of Af. radula, which has the
same acropetally developing pseudoraceme but
paleaceous calyx. Much has been made in the
past of the indumentum of diversipila, which
(in the typical form) consists, at least on stem
and leaf-stalk, of plumose setae which become
shorter on the leaflet-faces, sometimes com-
pressed almost into stellae. Micheli originally de-
scribed M. diversipila as a member of ser. Lep-
idotae, and while Burkart (1948: 182) recognized
its genetic relationship to the group known as
Meticulosae (sensu lato), he persisted (1964: 378),
with reservations, in giving it a place in his re-
vision of ser, Lepidotae. This arrangement can
no longer pass muster, especially now that we
are acquainted on the one hand with Af. ther-
marum and M. lanuginosa, unquestionably akin
to M. radula sensu lato (some forms of which
have scabrous setae), and on the other with the
habitally similar and sympatric group of micro-
species of which M4. brevipes was the first de-
scribed. To these Af. diversipila is firmly linked
by its Argentine var. subglabriseta, described
herein, in which the whole plant form is that of
typical M. diversipiia except that the cauline setae
are not plumose but merely scaberulous at base
and essentially smooth distally. Plumose setae
have made several independent appearances in
Mimosa—see for examples haplostermonous Af.
pseudolepidota and diplostemonous M4. suru-
muénsis—and become significant indicators of
affinity only when coordinated with supporting
characters.
Burkart (1948, remarked that the bristles
of most Argentine plants referred to M]. diversi-
pila are not really plumose, but only scaberulous,
and he identified a similar plant, in which the
setae are all essentially smooth or almost so as
the distinct species M. setistipuia Bentham. Gen-
uine M. setistipula, while morphologically sim-
ilar to M. diversipila in leaf-formula and often
in the minute calyx, is a frutescent mimosa of
highland central Minas Gerais, different not only
in habit and ecology but also in the hysteran-
thously foliate pseudoraceme, longer peduncles
(15-30, not 4-16 mm), and ped nearly twice as
wide. Its probable relationship is not with the
campo-dwelling Brevipedes but with M. pogo-
cephala and allied species of Sa. do Espinhaco.

This poorly known mimosa resembles some
ofthe coarser unarmed forms of M. xanthocentra
in virgate habit, downswept leaves, thin-textured
leafiets, and long, hysteranthously foliate pseu-
doraceme, but it differs in venation of the leaflets,
in minute (not pappiform) calyx, and in retrorse-
ly pilosulous corolla-lobes. The parallel venation
of the leaflets sets it well apart from the habitally
similar and sympatric M4. brevipes, and the
smooth setae from M. diversipila. The leaflet-
venation is oddly reminiscent of sect. Habbasia,
and is unique in sect. Mimosa. The true affinity
of M. fernandez-casasii may become clearer when
the fruit is found, but for the present the species
seems to fit more easily into subser. Brevipedes
than elsewhere in ser. Afimosa.

The indumentum of 4. cryptogioea is unique
in subser. Brevipedes by an undercoat of short
secretory setulae largely concealed by puberu-
lence and long plain setae, but evident under
magnification. The plant is otherwise very like
the compatriot M,. sceptrum, which has similarly
long corollas but leaflets at once fewer and larger,
and M. custodis, which has leaflets of about the
same number but smaller and only two-, not
three-nerved, in addition to substantially smaller
flowers. An insufficiency of collections and lack
of mature fruits are at present insuperable ob-
stacles to rational assessment of these differences.

Mimosa sceptrum resembles M. brevipes and
M. custodis in virgate growth-form, indetermi-
nate pseudoraceme of capitula, and minute ca-
lyx, but differs from both in fewer larger leaflets
and fatter capitula of larger flowers; and is further
distinguished from M, brevipes in the seemingly
valvate dehiscence of the pad and in the contin-
uous marginal nerve of the less prominently
nerved leaflets. These species all occur in close
proximity on Sa. de Amambay, and Af. sceptriun
may perhaps have arisen through introgression
between M. brevipes or M. custodis and some
sympatric form of Af, dolens, which could have
contributed the genes for valvately dehiscent
fruits borne in a dense sphere, but which is con-
sistently distinguished from Ad. brevipes and its
allies by the determinate pseudoraceme.

Mimosa custodis is manifestly akin to M. brev-
ipes, but differs in weakly 2-nerved, not promi-
nently 4—5-nerved leaflets, in generally longer pe-
duncles (10-30, not 4-14 mm), in obsolete calyx,
and substantially longer flowers (2.9-3.6, not 1.5—
2.6 mm). It is named in honor of Teodoro Rojas
(1877-1954), keeper of Emile Hassler’s herbar-
tum in Asunci6én, who collected for the first time
many of the remarkable endemic plants of
Amambay province.

Mimosa longiracemosa was subordinated by
Burkart to M. callosa. The resemblance in foliage
is strong, but the inflorescence of AZ. longirace-
mosa lacks the terminal precociously flowering
capitulum of M. cailosa, consisting rather of about
15-30 capitula that flower by acropetal stages of
a few at a time. The flowers of M. callosa are
pubernulent at apex and are subtended by setose-
ciliate bracts, whereas the flowers of M4. longi-
racemosa are papiltate-fimbriolate with small
thickened trichomes and subtended by strongly
incurved bracts similarly fimbriolate and bereft
of setae.
For lack of evidence the specific status and
affinities of M. longiracemosa within the genus
cannot be considered settled. It appears poised
morphologically between subser. Dolentes and
subser. Brevipedes, having the fruiting characters
of the former but the inflorescence of the latter.
It is here provisionally referred to subser. Brevip-
edes by arbitrary emphasis on the indeterminate
mode of the long efoliate pseudoraceme,

This and the next following differ from other
Brevipedesin their relatively few, distant and long-
petiolate leaves. They may be misplaced in the
subseries, but I can find no more appropriate
affiliation in ser. Mimosa. Specific characters of
nitiduia in this setting are the wandlike growth-
habit and relatively numerous and small, lus-
trous leaflets which forcefully recall those of the
microphyllidious varieties of M4. dolens found in
southeastern Paraguay, one of which may have
played a part in its genesis. It is known at present
from the one collection cited, the origin of which
is not precisely recorded.

strangely referred by Micheli to his own AZ. oligo-

leaf-formula, leaflet-size, and espiculate leaf-
stalks; and was later equated by Chociat & Hass-
ler with the rare Brazilian planaltine M. petio-
faris, again quite different in leaf-formula and
further so in the paleaceous calyx and monadel-
phous filaments of subser. Polycephailae. Its pre-

The plant provisionally described as Mf. fon-
ticola is in the earliest stage of anthesis and in-
sufficient as a basis for formal description. It was
mistaken by Glaziou for Af. dofens, but is un-
armed and eglandular, and has a long, apparently
indeterminate virgate inflorescence of a type usu-
ally associated with a craspedially dehiscent fruit.
Its characters are given here in detail in order to
draw attention of Brazilian botanists to the ex-
istence ofan undescribed mimosa in need of study
in the field. It bears a strong likeness in most
characters to the Paraguayan M. custodis, but has
developed leaf-stalks, one-nerved leaflets, and
very short peduncles. Mimosa dolens var. lati-
folia is also similar except in the determinate
inflorescence.

In campo rupestre on iron-rich soils, on steep
stony hillsides, and in crevices of outcrops, 900-
1850 m, locally plentiful about the summits and
higher slopes of Sa. do Espinhago between 19°50’

Brazil.—Fi. VI-IX(H); fr. I-11.
In 1841, when Bentham described Af. pogo-
cephala, M. erinacea and M. eriocaulis, there were
only four collections available for comparison,
and only one of these showed the fruit. Material
accumulated and by 1875 Bentham realized that
the first two propositions were based on the flow-
ering and fruiting stages of one species, endemic
to central Minas Gerais. No further example of
M. eriocaulis had come to hand, and the initial
misconception as to its origin in Goids supported
the idea that it was different from the rest, al-
though no better distinguishing characters could
be found (Bentham, 1876: 297, in clave) than
relatively long peduncles and short floral bracts
fully exposing the flower-buds.
Variation in pubescence of M. pogocephata is
related to dispersal but not fully or exactly so,
All material seen from Sas. da Moeda, do Curral,
do Itabirito and from the immediate environs of
Belo Horizonte is characterized by leaflets gray-
puberulent on both faces. The type of M. erio-
caulis, believed to have been collected on the
road between Queluz and Barbacena, has leaflets
puberulent beneath only, glabrous above. Both
these pubescence-states occur on Sa. da Piedade.
Plants from the southernmost known locality on
Sa. de Tiradentes also have leaflets glabrous
above, and are further peculiar for more explicit
venulation and for long-tailed setae. Fruits from
this serra are needed to confirm the specific iden-
tity. Mimosa pogocephaia is apparently replaced
on Sa. do Cipé and on Sa. do Caraga by /.
bombycina and M. montis-carasae, respectively.
The sympatric Mf. multiplex is readily distin-
guished by low herbaceous stature and glabrous
stems.

Mimosa parviceps is closely akin to Af. pogo-
cephaia, but apparently different in greater stat-
ure, persistent stipules, fewer (10-13, not 12-23)
pairs of leaflets in longer pinnae, longer pedun-
cles but smaller capitula, and particularly in the
longer, proportionately narrower pod pilose with
ascending, minutely scaberulons setae, not
coarsely hispid with stout, bulbous-based smooth
ones. The also closely related M. montis-carasae
has deciduous stipules, somewhat thicker capit-
ula, and pod thinly hispid with vertically erect
setae. It is found at greater elevations (1 500—-
1900 m) and at points distant about two degrees
of latitude southward along Serra do Espinhago.
A peculiar specimen from close to the type-
locality of M. parviceps and very similar to it in
most characters (CFCR 2216, NY) cannot at
present be classified with assurance. It differs from
typical M. parviceps in bearing a few small scat-
tered prickles on the stems (unknown in most
other Pogocephaiae) and in different pubescence
of the seemingly more readily articulate pod. It
may represent MM. parviceps introgressed by some
aculeate species, but requires field-observation,

Mimosa adamantina is closely related to 44.
multiplex, vicariant southward on Sa. do Espi-
nhago in the latitude of Belo Horizonte. Com-
mon attributes are glabrous or nearly glabrous
foliage of dull chocolate-brown hue when dried,
a minute calyx, and a relatively short broad pod,
the ripe valves of which disarticulate imperfectly
or not at all. Whereas M. multiplex is essentially
herbaceous, its stems arising yearly from the root-
crown, Af. adamantina is an assurgent or erect
shmub, with older defoliate stems giving rise an-
nually to new leafy and fertile branches. Fur-
thermore, the stipules of Af. adamantina are on
the average narrower and its filaments further
exserted from the corolla. The pods of Ad. ada-
mantina may be either glabrous or pilose with
slender ascending setae, whereas those of M.
multiplex bear few scattered, grossly dilated con-
ical setae. Like numerous species endemic to the
upper levels of Sa. do Espinhago, 1. adamantina
has differentiated out into locally endemic vari-
ants, two of which deserve varietal status.

The name Mimosa muttiplex, one of several
proposed by Bentham in 1841-1842 for mi-
mosas collected by Sello at unknown stations in
Brazil, has not since been associated with a plant
of known provenance. The isotype formerly at
Berlin that survives in the form of Field Museum
Negative 2343 is, however, labelled “Serra da
and two modem collections from the
vicinity (Heringer s.n., BRADE 32532; Pabst &
al. 7198, NY) confirm its existence near 20°S in
central Minas Gerais, not in extratropical Brazil
whence came the majority of Sello’s mimosas.
As defined herein, Af. muttiplex is closely re-
lated 10 Mf. adamantina, which replaces it on Sa.
do Espinhago in approximately 1 8°-18°30'S. Very
similar in and floral structure, they
differ principally in growth-habit,
being herbaceous, with weak stems arising anew
each year from the rootstock, whereas M. ada-
mantina is decidedly fruticose, with slender de-
foliate trunks of one or more years’ duration that
bear aloft the fertile branches of the current sea-
son. Further small differences in stipules and pod-
vesture are brought out in the key to species.

The foregoing description of M. ernestii is part-
ly compiled from the protologue, aided by a pho-
totype and by fragments of the holotype pre-
served at the Field Museum, and partly from a
fruiting specimen, Brade 16626 (RB), also from
the Organ Mts. The two collections are essen-
tially similar except that Ule 4204 is remotely
aculeate, the other unarmed and more amply
leafy. I feel confident, nevertheless, that they rep-
Tesent seasonal aspects of one species, but a firm-
er connection between them is obviously desir-
able. On the slender evidence provided by them
1 judge M. ernestii to be akin to M. pogocephata,
from which it differs in thin pubescence and es-
pecially in broader pod with heavy replum and
hispid mantle of coarse setae 2-6 mm long. The
aculei present in Ule 4204 might suggest kinship
to extratropical M. gymnas and M. atlantica, but
the valvate pod points rather in direction of Af.
pogocephala and its allies in upland central Mi-
nas Gerais.

Mimosa setistipula resembles M. lanata and
M. pogocephaia in many respects, but differs from
both in rather fewer (8-14, not 14-35 pairs of)
leafiets. It differs further from M. /anata in the
minute or strongly asymmetric calyx
and narrow stipules. Mimosa pogocephaia also
has broader stipules than M. setistipufa, and a
coarsely setose, bur-like, non-articulate pod. The
collections of Martius (369 = F neg. 6769, and
402, both Mt!) identified by Bentham as Af. se-
ustipula represent M. dolens var. acerba and var.

Burkart referred M. congestifolia to ser. Pe-

in that series. The species is in fact much closer
to habitally similar Mf. microcarpa and M. ita-
tiaiensis of central and southern Minas Gerais,
the first of which was aligned by Bentham with
his ser. Meticu/osae. It has much in common also
with M, bocainae and M. reduviosa, newly de-
scribed species narrowly endemic to eastern S.
Paulo and northeastern Parané respectively,
which are technically distinguished by reversed
setose indumentum of the stems. In the context
of this series of vicariant microspecies M. con-
gestifolia may be recognized by the combination
of relatively long pinnae and leaflets, broad
striately nerved stipules, and ellipsoid capitula
conelike prior to anthesis.

Mimosa reduviosa appears close kin to allo-
patric Af. bocainae, which it resembles particu-
larly in the retrorsely directed, scaberulous setae
of the stems and peduncles (whence the epithet,
from reduvium = hangnail). It differs from this
principally in three-, not two-nerved leaflets and
in globose, not ellipsoid capitula. Also similar in
habit of growth is M. paranapiacabae, but while
virtually sympatric with Af. reduviosa this differs
more decisively in antrorse, smooth setae of stems
and peduncles, in 5-9 (not +3)-nerved stipules,
in fewer (8-13, not 20-31) pairs of leaflets, and
in five-, not one-nerved Aoral bracts. Despite the
proximally retrorse (but distally often upswept)
orientation of cauline setae, Af. reduviosa and M.
Socainae together appear more closely related to
species with antrorse basifixed terete cauline se-
tae than to habitally similar M4. ourobrancoénsis
of subser. Obstrigosae, The setae of the latter are
not simply retrorse, but also stiffly appressed their
whole length, dorsiventrally compressed, and
minutely spurred at base.

Mimosa bocainae and M. reduviosa are sibiing
Species, suggestively similar in life-form and
ecology, in loosely retrorse and scabrous cauline
setae, and in form of the craspedium, but are
seermingly distinct in several coordinated char-
acters supported by vicariant distribution. The
diagnostic characters of M4. bocainae are linear
one-nerved stipules, immarginate leaflets with
only two long dorsal nerves, and ellipsoid, not
globose capitula. Afimosa itatiaiensis, which re-
places M, bocainae on nearby Mt. Itatiaia, differs
from both of these in forwardly ascending, smooth
cauline setae and in very small membranous,
minutely ciliolate (not pappiform) calyx.

bracts, and corolla-lobes, as recorded in the fore-
going key. The lower bracts in M4. microcarpa are

The known collections of 4. pedersenii have
been misidentified either as axillaris or M.
macrocalyx, between which they are in some re-
spects morphologically intermediate. The spe-
cies resembles Af. (subser, Axitlares) axillaris in
loosely spreading-ascending scaberulous setae of
stems and peduncles, but differs in uniformly
very short petioles, in relatively long calyx, and
in corollas only residually puberulent on margin
of the lobes with minute, forwardly appressed
hairs. From 44. macrocaiyx, of which it has the
calyx and almost glabrous corolla, 44, pedersenii
differs markedly in the character of the cauline
and peduncular setae, in somewhat shorter pin-
nae, and in plumper capitula, without filaments
4.5-5 (not 3.5—-4) mm in diam.
I dedicate this mimosa to Troels Myndel Pe-
dersen, distinguished Danish-Argentine student
of Amaranthaceae and the flora of subtropical
South America, whose many criticaily chosen
and beautifully prepared specimens of Mimosa
have contributed much to my knowledge of the
genus.

Burkart likened Af. fachinalensis to M. faici-
pinna, from which it differs most obviously in
venation of leaflets, in armply paleaceous calyx,
and in moist extratropical montane habitat. From
habitally similar and more nearly sympatric A.
reptans it may be distinguished by three-, not
one-nerved stipules, slenderly callous-margin-
ate, three-, not two-nerved leaflets, peduncles
retropilose below the capitulum, enlarged calyx,

Mimosa luciana differs from all other Rep-
tantesin stiffly branched stems, small short leaves,
and shortly pedunculate capitula, consequently
in general habit and appearance. In firm-tex-
tured, strongly marginate leaflets it resembles
sympatric M. schleidenii, but the corolla is ret-
rostrigulose only below the lobes, which are
lcosely antrorse-puderulent. While I have no
doubt about its status as a distinct species, the
affinities of M. /uciana may require reassessment
as more is learned about its habitat, dispersal,
and possible origin through introgression be-
tween MM. schleidenii and some other group of
ser, Mimosa.

This poorly known inconspicuous mimosa was
appended by Bentham to his series Meticulosae
subdivision Vuigares, remote from what I con-
jecture to be a nearer ally, M4. paupera, which
was assigned to ser. Pedunculosae. It resembles
+M. paupera in stature, but is more densely leafy,
and has rather similar, though smaller, pinnae,
of elliptic outline when fully expanded. The ret-
rostrigulose flower is that of other Reprantes, but
the calyx is shortly pappiform rather than min-
ute. The morphological syndrome is not really
convincing evidence of relationship to Rep-
tantes, but I can find no group more receptive.

In the context of subser. Reprantes a syndrome
of generally diffuse stems, slender petioles, con-
jugate and short, relatively few-foliolate pinnae

ly always much diminished both up and down-
ward from near mid-rachis, forming when fully
displayed a composite blade of elliptic outline.

Here assembled under the collective name M.
distans will be found elements derived from two
Benthamian series of Eumimosa: from ser. Pe-
dunculosae, M. elongata and M. distans, and from
ser. Meticulosae, M. neuroloma. Bentham sep-
arated these species by inconstant characters of
pinna-number and by strength of setae that run
together to form a pallid marginal nerve of vari-
able girth. But these and others subsequently dis-
covered are essentially identical in morphology
of the flower and fruit, and have in common a
distinctive subdimidiate leaflet and retrostrigu-
lose corolla.
The constituent varieties of A/. distans are con-
veniently divided by leaf-formula into a subsp.
elongata, in which the pinnae vary in number
from one to two, two to five, or four to eight
pairs, and a subsp. disfans, in which the pinnae
are stabilized at exactly one pair. The latter is
widely dispersed, in the form of var. distans, over
much of the Brazilian Planalto, and is repre-
sented in the central highlands by a relatively
Tare var. neuroloma. The subsp. elongata is com-
posed of several, more local, varieties concen-
trated in central Goids and the Federal District
but has an outlying member in Paraguay. This
pattern of dispersal is comparable, on a more
modest scale, to that described for Af. somnians:
one widespread subspecies, ostensibly primitive
relative to the rest, containing within its compass
increasingly specialized and geographically re-
stricted derivatives. If this hypothesis is correct,
the varieties of M. distans with plurijugate leaves
have arisen from conjugately pinnate ancestry.

Mimosa distans and M. neureloma, here more
closely associated as varieties of M. distans, were
first described, each from few collections, as
members of ser. Meticulosae ***Semistrigosae,
and M. neuroloma was confused, in the first in-
stance, with M. meticulosa Martius, which Ben-
tham later found to be something else (exactly
what is even today unknown). Bentham admit-
ted to difficulty in distinguishing these two spe-
cies, and the difficulty has not been dissipated
by modern collections. In his monograph Ben-
tham (1875, 1876) transferred M. distans to ser.
Pedunculosae, stating (1876; 326) that despite
nearly dimidiate leaflets it was readily distin-
guished from MV. neuroloma, retained in ser. Me-
ticulosae, by form of inflorescence, meaning, it
seems, by relative length and arrangement of the
peduncles. It is no longer possible, however, to
separate two credible species by peduncle-length
or by prevalence of strictly axillary longer pe-
duncles over pseudoracemose shorter ones.
Shifting emphasis ta length and proximity along
the stem of cauline leaves, length of leaf-stalks
and girth of setae on leaflet-margin, each to some
degree individually variable, it is possible to
maintain two taxa, but only at the varietal level.

sembles in a general way M. reptans and M. ax-
iflaris, but differs in spiciform capitula, disre-
garding filaments 3-6 times as long as their diam.
The strongly bicolored, ventrally convex and
glossy green, dorsally concave and pallid leaflets.
combined with corollas clothed below middle
with retrorse hairs suggest affinity to Af. per—
dusenii and M. dryandroides. These, however,
are erect subshrubs with globose or only incipi-
ently elongating capitula, their leaflets are dense-
ly felted beneath, and their flowers are retrostri-
gulose overall.
Burkart described three varieties of M. nieder-
leinii, differing in pubescence of stems and leaf-
lets. The var. niederleinii, represented by the type
alone, had forwardly appressed cauline setae and
leaflets at once puberulent and strigose dorsally.
The var. riograndensis was said 10 differ only in
leaflets either glabrous or simply puberulent but
not strigose beneath; whereas var. pseudolepidota
had spreading, plumose cauline setae. The in-
dumentum of the latter coincides with a modified
paleaceous calyx in what is here interpreted as a
specifically significant syndrome of characters,
but vars. riograndensis and niederieinii lack dif-
ferences correlated with pubescence. Among du-
Plicates of collections identified by Burkart as
var. riograndensis 1 find these intermediate or
contradictory forms: Hatschbach 24207 (NY)
from Piraquara, Parana has proximal leaflets of
some leaves densely setose beneath but distal
ones puberulent only; and Smith and Klein 11316
(US) from municipio Lages, Sta. Catarina, has
stems hispid like those of var. pseudolepidora but
with perfectly smooth setae. The var. riogran-
densis cannot be exactly characterized and is here
reduced to synonymy of M. niederleinit.

The type-collection of M. pseudolepidota was
identified by Burkart as a new species of this
name, but published as a variety of M. nieder-
deinii. The appropriate status of this remarkable
plant remains debatable. On the one hand a close
resemblance in most organs indicates near kin-
ship to Ad. niederleinii, but the paleaceous calyx
coupled with subplumose, loosely reflexed setose
indumentum of the stems and leaf-axes suggests
a substantial genetic modification, here inter-
preted as of specific consequence,

While similarity in habit and in most technical
details suggests that M. kuhnisteroides is very
closely akin to Mf. niederieinii, the correlation in
the presently available materia! of small differ-
ences listed in the diagnosis justifies specific seg-
regation. A further differential character of MJ.
kuhnisteroides is the lack of paraphyllidia at base
of the pinna-rachis, a feature constantly observed
in related species. The epithet refers to an odd
similarity in the shortly cylindric capitula of re-
trorsely silky florets and long-exserted pink fil-
aments to Dalea (formerly Petalostemon or
Kuhnistera) tenuis (Coulter) Shinners.

Because of scaberulous setae and capitate flow-
ers M. axillaris strongly suggests Af. (subser.
Macrocalycinae) pedersenii, but differs in espicu-
late leaf-stalks, shorter calyx (about half, not
three-fourths or more, as long as corolla), and in
corollas retrostrigose overall. A probably isotyp-
ic specimen (Seilo s.n., BM) has one capitulum
about twice as long as wide hinting at the species’
true kinship to spicate Af. niederieinii. In retro-
strigulose flowers and marginate leaflets M4. ax-
i#laris resembles AM. schigidenii, but this has many
fewer and much larger leaflets. Bentham’s record
(1876: 326) of M. axillaris from Goias is based
on a specimen of M. distans.

Mimosa dryandroides resembles M. per-du-
Senii in marginally revolute, conspicuously bi-
colored leaflets dark shiny green above and
densely white-felted beneath, and in retrorsely
gray-strigulose flowers. It differs from M. per—
dusenii in antrorsely appressed pubescence of
stems, in leaflets alternate along the pinna-rachis,
and in pappiform calyx. The species consists of
two widely dissevered varieties, var. dryan-
droides isolated on the Organ Mountains in Rio
de Janeiro, and var. extratropica distant 800 ki-
Jometers to the southwest in high campos of east-
ern Parana. The range of var. extratropica, so far
as known at present, lies within that of kindred
AM. per—dusenii. In addition to the specific dis-
tinctions already mentioned, var. exzvatropica has
oblong-cylindric capitula, Af. per—dusenii glo-
bose ones.
Taubert described the flower of Af. dryan-
droides as diplostemonous, but I myself have
found only four stamens in all flowers examined.
There can be no question that the species belongs
in genuine Miniosa, not in sect. Habbasia.

In the protologue Harms referred M. widgrenii
to ser. Myriophyliae Bentham, the only described
group that could accommodate a haplostemo-
nous mimosa with armed stems and pluripinnate
leaves. It differs from Myriophyliae, as defined
herein, by weak scrambling stems serially acu-
leate with recurved prickles, by axillary pedun-
cles, and by retrostrigulose flowers. Its gross ap-
pearance recalls diplostemonous diplotricha,
but it has the setae and few-ovulate pod of sect.
Mimosa. In the latter setting the combination of
pluripinnate leaves and retrostrigulose flowers is
otherwise unknown. I have no plausible conjec-
ture as to the true relationship of M4. widgrenii,
the unique character of which is best expressed
by subserial status.

Mimosa modesta, a species of local dispersal
in central and northern Bahia and in adjoining
Piaui, Brazil, is most closely akin to sympatric
but less common Af. honesta, which differs prin-
cipally in ascending fruticulose, not humifuse
herbaceous stems more densely clad in short-
petiolate leaves. Its perennial woody rootstock,
long pedunctes, much thicker capitula and longer
filaments distinguish it from the also partly sym-
patric Af. ursina. The known populations of AZ.
modesta vary in length, density and distribution
of the indumentum, and the armature of the nodes
is in some collections erratic, varying from plant
1o plant. They appear to fall, nevertheless, into
two series, one consisting of slender, short-setose
or glabrate, small-leaved plants found on the At-
lantic slope and eastern approaches of Chapada
Diamantina, the other of coarser, more densely
pubescent and more amply leafy ones, vicariant
to the northwest in and around the lower Sao
Francisco valley.

In Flora brasiliensis Bentham remarked of Af.
honesta that it recalled ser. Modestae at first sight,
but was better referred to ser. Meticulosae on
account of its frutescent stems, stiff leaves, and
other unspecified features. There is, however, to
this day no known member of Meticulosae (or
equivalent series) that resembles 44. modesta in
detail, whereas its leaf-structure, in particular the
sensitive tissue of the pinna-rachis at insertion
of the leaflets, is entirely compatible with ser.
Modestae, indeed unique to this one group. The
species appears to be closely akin to, and very
likely derived from the also Bahian, but much
more variable Af. modesta (which see for further
contrasts), differing most obviously in dwarf-
shrubby, not procumbent-subherbaceous growth-
habit.

The foregoing description of M. skinneri ac-
commodates three hitherto distinct specific con-
cepts: M. desmodioides of planaltine Brazil,
thought to have only conjugate pinnae in all
leaves; similar plants, including the type of Mf.
minima Burkart, with partly or consistently bi-
jugate pinnae; and those morphologically similar
Central American mimosas that have been mis-
taken for or segregated from Af. ursina. These
include MM. fetraneura Brandegee, M4. longicema
Britton & Rose, Af. germana Standley & Wil-
liams, and the type of M. skinneri Bentham, re-
cently shown by Grether (1987) to be the oldest
available epithet. The known populations of Af.
skinneri sensu lato in its two, widely dissevered
areas of dispersal are about equally diverse in
composition and density of indumentum,
whether of stem or pod, the puberulent and se-
tose elements varying independently of one an-
other and sometimes, one or both, suppressed.
Tenuous distinctions between North and South
American M, skinneri can be discerned in width
of pod and in size of capitula, which are ellipsoid
and plumply many-flowered in Brazil, but cur-
binate or suborbicular and a trifle narrower in
Central America, thus approaching in girth the
tiny capitula of M. ursina, Where M. skinneri
and M, ursina coincide in range, and this occurs
so far as known only in North America, the latter
is readily recognized by invariably conjugate pin-
nae, leaflets corneously marginate, and pods
characteristically prickly over each seed, On Ser-
ta dos Carajas in southeastern Para Af. skinneri
is represented by a glabrate var. carajarum no-
table for a slenderly stipitate pod; and in south-
western Mato Grosso by a var. minima, weakly
distinguished by a few- but broad-articulate one.
The unexpectedly rich synonymy that has
grown up around Af, skinneri in North America
is due in part to the accident that the type of A#.
desmodioides is a relatively uncommon variant
with pinnae stabilized at one pair, a character
crucial in Bentham’s classification of the genus,
but in part to observed differences in indumen-
tum, the importance of which has been exagger-
ated.

Burkart appears to have described M. minima
as specifically distinct from M4. desmodioides in
the belief that the latter had uniformly one pair
of pinnae in all leaves. Once this misapprehen-
sion is disposed of, Af. minima differs only in
marginally diminished stature and in a pod at
once broader and fewer-seeded than that of AZ.
skinneri var. desmodioides, but no broader than
that of var. skinneri. The setose pubescence of
the pod valves varies even in one capitulum from
sparse to none. Since typical var. desmodioides
has now been collected in the upper Paraguai
basin, separate taxonomic status for Af. minima,
even as a variety, needs stronger justification than
is presented in the key. More numerous fruiting
specimens of var. desmodioides are required be-
fore any solid distinction between it and var.
minima can be attained.

A gregariously weedy mimosa flourishing in a
variety of sunny, often disturbed habitats, of bi-
centric range in e, Brazil and Central America:
in Brazil] widespread and certainly native in cer-
rado, caatinga and savanna, on lateritic, rarely
calcareous, often vernally inundated soils be-
tween 300 and 950 m, from the Balsas valley
near 7°S in s. Maranhio e, to n. Ceara at +4°S
and centr. Pernambuco, s. through centr. and w.
Bahia to 16°30’S in n.-w, Minas Gerais, thence
barely entering e.-centr. Goias; and locally abun-
dant in grassy and sandy places, sometimes in
open pineforest and occasionally on roadsides,
(150-)750-1500 m, perhaps not aboriginally na-
tive but long established in Central America, from
Oaxaca to Tabasco, Mexico, s.-e. through Pacific
and highland Guatemala and El Salvador to s.-
w. Honduras.—Fl. in Brazil XI-IV, in Mexico
and Central America (VII-)VIII-I.—A specimen
of A. ursina, Glaziou 9772 cited by Glaziou
(1906: 178) as collected at Araruama near Cabo
Frio in Rio de Janeiro, has not been considered
in the statement of range, the locality being under
suspicion until confirmed. Map 67.
Mimosa ursina is notable in its series for
monocarpic duration, consistently armed nodes,
conjugate pinnae incurved in the distinctive mode
of ser. Modestae, small, shortly pedunculate ca-
pitula, and proportionately broad pod armed at
middle of each article with a few stout erect
prickles.

Diminutive unarmed humifuse Aerd with very
slender, randomly branched stems from a knotty
subterranean caudex and rooting from infrastip-
ular cibs at many or most nodes, commonly
forming dense mats of foliage, the petioles of the
highly sensitive, conjugately pinnate lvs and the
solitary peduncles subvertically ascending, the
stems either glabrous or thinly hispidulous with
scattered setulae +0.5-0.8 mm, the stipules and
fioral bracts setose-ciliolate, the subconcolorous
dark green Ifts all facially glabrous or the first
pair of some pinnae thinly strigose dorsally, all
weakly setulose-ciliolate or not so. Stipules erect
submembranous, ovate or obovate 0.8-2 x 0.6-
1.2 mm, either nerveless or weakly 1-3-nerved,
persistent. Leaf-statks subfiliform (7-)10-35(-55)
mm, narrowly sulcate ventrally; spicule 0; pinnae
the rachis S—13(-17) mm, discolored dor-
sally between insertion of each pair of pulvinules,
the longer interfoliolar segments 0,6-1.7 mm; lfts
3-5(-6)-jug., subaccrescent upward, the first pair
0.6--1.7 mm distant from pulvinus (paraphyllidia
0), the blades oblong-obovate obtuse from ob-
tusangulate base, the longer ones x 1-2.5
mm, 2-2.7(-3) times as long as wide, all veinless
above, beneath 2(-3)-nerved from pulvinule, the
simple or weakly 1-2-branched midrib dividing
blade 1:1,5—2, the inner (or only) posterior nerve
expiring or faintly brochidodrome beyond mid-
blade, the outer one when present short and weak.
Pedunciles solitary subfiliform (2-)5-25 mm, ei-
ther shorter or longer than the subtending If,
commonly humistrate in fruit; capitula 5-9-fild,
1.5-2 mm diam. at middle, the fis and filaments
all erect; bracts narrowly ovate 0.8-1.2 x 0.4-
0.5 mm, dorsally glabrous 1-nerved, weakly set-
ulose-ciliolate, persistent; flowers sessile,
4-merous 4-androus, all bisexual; calyx mem-
branous, shallowly campanulate 0.3-0.45 mm,
the deltate fimbriolate teeth 0.15-0.2 mm; co-
rolla (1.5-)1.7-2.4 mm, subtubular, the erect
ovate 1-nerved lobes 0.6-0.9 x 0.4 mm; fila-
ments whitish, free, exserted 2.5-4 mm. Pods 1-
4 per capitulum, stipitate, the stipe 2.5-3.5 mm,
slightly widened upward, the 1l-seeded body
asymmetrically ovate in profile 3.5-4.5 = 2.5-
3.2 mm, lateraily compressed but turgidly dilat-
ed over the seed, the smooth replum +0.2 mm
wide produced into a very short curved cusp, the
papery greenish, microscopically granular valves
either glabrous or thinly setulose over the seed,
tardily and often incompletely separating from
replum; in many (but not all) pods a nodule at
base of fertile article on each side giving rise 10
1-2 adventitious rootlets apparently anchoring
the pod to the soil; seed plumply obevoid-len-
ticular 2-2.6 x 1.6—1.8 mm, the testa dark brown.
In moist pastures, on lawns, and on grassy
roadsides, apparently local but probably much
overlooked, known only from Cuba (La Habana
. to Oriente—cf. Bassler, and Jamaica, — Fl,
VII-tIL, perhaps irregularly through the year.

This greatly modified mimosa is related, but
not very closely, to M4. skinneri, from which it
differs in filiform, always radicant and unarmed
stems, 1-2 (not leaflets, extremely
harrow capitula, and pods obligately 1-seeded.
The adventitious rootlets that emerge from a
nodule at base of the pod’s one article have no
counterpart in the genus. Field observation will
show whether these rootlets are contractile and
serve to drag the fruit into the ground, or merely
anchor it at the surface. The foliage of AZ. viva
is said to form extensive mats in low-lying pas-
ture and, being instantly sensitive to shock, pro-
vides a canvas for ephemeral graffiti drawn upon
it with a stick or finger.
