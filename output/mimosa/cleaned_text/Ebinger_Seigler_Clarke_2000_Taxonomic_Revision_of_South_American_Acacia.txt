Acacia collinsii is the only ant-acacia known from South America.
This species has enlarged stipular spines inhabited by acacia-ants of the genus Pseudomyrmex (Ward 1993) and beltian bodies on the tips of the leaflets.
Cyanide tests of more than 400 specimens of Acacia collinsii from throughout its geographic range indicate that this species is not cyanogenic (Seigler and Ebinger 1995).
Herbarium material of this species was reported cyanogenic (Seigler et al. 1978), but reinvestigation of these same specimens failed to confirm activity (Seigler and Ebinger 1987).
Janzen (1981) did not report cyanogenesis for this taxon.

Acacia rorudiana is restricted to Ecuador, and mostly to the Galapagos Islands, though Rudd (1971) indicated that it may occur in Chile.
This taxon has been variously treated as a distinct species (Robinson 1902; Rudd 1971), and as a synonym of A. macracantha (Svenson 1946).
The stalked bulbous glands on the petiole and rachis of A. rorudiana are much different from the stalked, flattened glands of A. macracantha.
Also in A. rorudiana, the small (0.6- 2.8 mm long), narrow leaflets (0.3-0.8 mm wide), the short petiole (2-8 mm long), the short shoots above each pair of stipular spines, the extreme variation in the number of pinna pairs per leaf (12 to 35), and the wide fruits (10-17 mm) separate this taxon from A. macracantha.
In this study, no specimen referable to A. macracantha was found on the Galapagos Islands; all specimens previously annotated by various authors as A. macracantha are here referred to A. rorudiana.
Adsersen et al. (1988) found that both fresh and preserved material of A. rorudiana were strongly cyanogenic.
In our study more than 75% of the 63 herbarium specimens tested were strongly cyanogenic.
Usually more recently collected material gave a stronger positive test than material that was collected 30 to 50 years ago.

Throughout its geographic range Acacia macracantha is highly variable morphologically, numerous varietal and specific names have been applied to plants of this species (Bentham 1875; Isely 1973; Madsen 1990; Seigler and Ebinger 1988).
This taxon is highly variable in the type and degree of pubescence on vegetative parts of the plant, ranging from glabrous to puberulent in most of Mexico and northern South America, to densely pubescent in the Caribbean Islands, to densely lanate throughout much of Chile, Ecuador, and Peru.
Also, leaf and leaflet size varies extensively.
Throughout northern South America (Columbia and Venezuela), and north through Central America, most individuals have leaves with 18 to 45 pinna pairs and the leaflets that exceed 3.0 mm. in length; whereas in Chile, Ecuador, and Peru many individuals have smaller leaves (12-20 pinna pairs) and leaflets (1.7-2.5 mm long).
These characteristics are not consistent enough to distinguish separate varieties or subspecies, as many individuals with intermediate characteristics are encountered.
Aronson (1991), discussing the distribution of this species in Chile, mentioned that the "variability in size and shape of the pods, leaves, and stipular spines of A. macracantha has led to its being split into numerous regional taxa, many of which appear to be of dubious Acacia macracantha specimens are usually cyanogenic.
In specimens from Mexico and Central America, Seigler and Ebinger (1988) found 89% were cyanogenic.
In our study, of the 230 specimens examined, 91% tested positive for cyanide, usually strongly so.
The compound proacacipetalin is responsible for this activity (Seigler et al. 1978, Seigler and Conn 1982).

The only species in South America that A. aroma is usually confused with is A. macracantha, Though superficially similar, numerous characteristics can be used for consistent separation.
Acacia aroma has flattened fruits that are constricted between the seeds, many of the peduncles are more than 22mm long, and the petiole glands are sessile.
Acacia macracantha, in contrast, has flattened fruits that are not constricted between the seeds, the peduncles are less than 25 mm long, and the petiole gland is stalked.
Besides the characteristics listed above, short shoots are common in A. aroma, whereas they are mostly absent in A. macracantha.
These short shoots, which develop just above the stipular spines, usually produce many small leaves.
It is not uncommon for these short shoot leaves to lack a petiolar gland, or the gland is smaller and more bulbous than on the node leaves.
It appears that A. aroma is only rarely cyanogenic.
Aronson and Nash (1989) reported negative results for this species, while Aronson (1990) found some seedlings to be slightly to moderately cyanogenic.
Of the 220 specimens tested during the present study 215 gave a negative reaction even after the addition of emulsin.
A weak positive cyanogenic reaction was observed in five specimens.
Seigler and Conn (1982) found linamarin and lotaustralin to be the principal glycosides in this species.

Most herbarium labels indicate that the specimens were low growing, prostrate shrubs less than 1m tall with a crown diameter of 2-3 m.
From the information on the herbarium sheets, as well as what is mentioned by Svenson (1946) and Madsen (1990), this taxon commonly grows directly on wind-exposed sandy sea-shores or just behind mangroves.
At higher elevations, it commonly is found along water courses where specimens are reported to be less than 1 m tall and nearly 5 m across.
Specimens of Acacia aroma var. huarango are consistently more puberulent that var. aroma, particularly on the leaflets of var: huarango, which are lightly puberulent on the lower surface.
In addition, the petiolar glands of var. marango are nearly circular, smaller (0.4-0.9 mm across), more bulbous and usually densely puberulent.
This variety also differs from var. aroma in that the leaflets (mostly less than 2.5 mm long), petioles (3-5 mm long), pinnae (less than 20 mm long), and the number of leaflets per pinna (less than 30) are at the lower size range for A. aroma var. aroma.
Occasional specimens of var. Iwarango are cyanogenic; of the 30 specimens examined, five gave a weak reaction after 12 hours.
Macbride (1943), in a list of representative specimens, cited a Ruiz and Pav6n specimen, (Hudnuco: near Hudnuco, low spreading shrub) as the lectotype.
A specimen at F (#845461) with the label Plantae a "Ruiz et Pavén'' in vice-regno Peruviano et Chilensi lectae (1778-1788) is probably the specimen mentioned as the lectotype.

The large, sessile petiolar glands, the dense, gray to yellow-green pubescence that covers most young parts of the plant, and the wider (16-30 mm) fruits distinguished Acacia pennatula from other South American acacias of subgenus Acacia.
Of the material examined from Mexico, only 21% of the specimens tested contained cyanogenic compounds (Seigler et al. 1978; Seigler and Conn 1982; Seigler and Ebinger 1988), whereas all South American specimens of A. pennatula were cyanogenic, usually strongly so.

Acacia karroo Hayne is a highly variable, polymorphic taxon in which formal intraspecific categories are not easily recognized (Ross, 1979).
It dif fers from all native South American acacias by having the involucral bracts near the middle of the peduncle, and legumes that have an endocarpic strip along the inside of each valve, a characteristic otherwise found in members of the Acacia rigidula complex of North America (Lee et al, 1989).

A filament-tube occurs in some members of Acacia insulae-iacobi, a condition mentioned by Riley (1925) in the original description.
During the present study eight flowering specimens, mostly from San Salvador, had filament-tubes, sometimes to 1.5 mum long. The tube was very delicate, and separated easily into the individual filaments.
The floral remains at the base of young fruits of some of these specimens had the filaments separate.
The specimens with a filament-tube generally were more robust, had slightly larger, and more leaves, and were possibly associated with more mesic conditions.
This taxon has been considered conspecific with A. albicorticata (Rudd 1971) as both have short spur branches, bipinnately compound leaves with 1 to 4 pairs of pinnae, relatively large leaflets (usually exceeding 7 mm in length) with obvious secondary veins, and similar rachis glands.
Numerous characteristics, however, can be used for consistent separation, the most obvious being the papery, peeling bark of A. albicorticata.
Also, in A. insulae-iacobi, petioles are 1-6 mm long and have a medial gland, the inflorescence is solitary, and the calyx is 1.5-2.2 mm long. In A. albicorticata, in contrast, the petiole is 7— 30 mm long, the petiolar gland is located between the lower pina pair, the inflorescences are clustered, and the calyx is 1.0-1.4 mm long. Both species appear to be related to A. farnesiana, and that species is the probable sister species to A. insulaeiacobi in mainland Ecuador.
Adsersen et al. (1988) found living material of this species to be strongly cyanogenic.
Of the 37 herbarium specimens tested for the presence of cyanogenic compound during the present study, none gave a positive test even after adding emulsin.
It is possible that the cyanogenic glycoside or the enzyme involved with cyanogenesis in this species was destroyed when the specimens were preserved.

Acacia albicorticata does not appear to be a common species, being restricted mostly to savannas in Argentina and Bolivia where its distinctive papery peeling bark separates it from other acacia species.
In many characteristics it appears to be a large form of A. farnesiana or A. tortuosa, but its larger, more widely spaced leaflets, and peeling, papery bark, separate A. albicorticata from these species.
Of the more than 75 specimens tested for the presence of cyanogenic compounds, none gave a positive test, even after the addition of emulsin.

Distribution.
In the New World this species occurs from the southem United States in southern Arizona, Texas and Florida south through the Bahamas and the West Indies, Mexico and Central America to Argentina in South America (Clarke et al. 1989) (Fig. 4C).
It occurs on relatively moist to seasonally dry sites in thickets, open pastures, successional fields and other disturbed sites from sea level to about 1500 m (Bush and Van Auken 1995).
Acacia farnesiana has a pantropical distribution, but was probably introduced in the Old World (Isely 1969).

Acacia farnesiana has been reported from most countries of South America.
In our study, we found no specimens from Chile or Uruguay, and only a few from Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay.
Reports of this taxon from southern South America mostly are based on specimens of A. atramentaria or A. caven, Seigler et al. (1979) found that the major cyanogenic glycosides of A. farnesiana are linamarin and lotaustralin, with levels of 5 umol per g of dried plant material not uncommon.
Clarke et al. (1989) reported that of the numerous Central American specimens of A. farnesiana tested for cyanide, 89% tested positive.
Although most tests were weak, a few were strongly positive.
Of the more than 150 specimens examined from South America, only 45% were cyanogenic, most being weakly positive.

Acacia atramentaria occurs in the same general habitat as A. can, disturbed thorn-scrub forests, where A. caven is the more common taxon.
The most distinctive characteristic separating this taxon from other species of Acacia in South America, is the sessile, torus-shaped petiolar gland at or just below the lower pinna pair, a characteristic it shares with A. schaffneri of North America.
On a few herbarium sheets, James Aronson suggested that A. atramentaria and A. caven occasionally hybridize (Aronson 7906, 7910, 7911 from San Luis, Argentina).
It is possible that these specimens represent hybrids as the fruits are essentially elliptical in cross section, and a little wider and thicker than is typical of A. atramentaria.
Only a small amount of pulpy material is present in the fruits, and the seeds are in a single row, traits of A. atramentaria.
Vegetative characteristics are within the range of those for A. atramentaria, including the doughnutshaped petiolar gland between the lowest pair of pinnae.
Further studies may clarify this situation.
Of the more than 40 specimens of this species tested for the presence of cyanogenic compounds, nearly 25% gave a strongly positive test within two hours.
Most of these positive tests were from recently collected specimens, indicating that the cyanogenic glycoside or the degradative enzyme deteriorated due to prolonged storage.
Seigler et al. (1979) reported that this taxon was strongly cyanogenic, and later (Seigler et al. 1983) determined that proacacipetalin was the glycoside responsible.
Aronson and Nash (1989) and Aronson (1990) also reported that A. atramentaria was cyanogenic.

Sousa and Rico (unpublished data) suggested that this taxon is of hybrid origin involving A. farnesiana and A. schaffneri var. schaffneri.
This seems unlikely as the plants appear fully fertile, and A. farnesiana is usually a tetraploid (2n = 52), whereas 'A. schaffneri is a diploid (2n = 26).
Also, this species occurs in many areas where A. schaffneri is absent or uncommon.
Janzen and Liesner (1980) recognized the distinctness of this taxon, citing the type collection, and suggested that it was most closely related to A. farnesiana.
Clarke et al. (1989) recognized these differences, as well as the similarity of this taxon to A. farnesiana, making it a variety of that species.
The unique morphological characteristics of this taxon, as well as its distribution support recognition as a separate species.
Clarke et al. (1989) reported that most specimens of this species were at least weakly cyanogenic, but the cyanogenic glycoside was not identified.
More recently, the authors have found many individuals of this species in Nicaragua that are not cyanogenic ever after the addition of emulsin.

Acacia caven is an extremely wide-ranging species that probably originated in the warm temperate to subtropical biogeographical region known as the Gran Chaco of southern South America due to high morphological diversity (Aronson and Ovalle, 1989).
This region extends through much of north central Argentina, adjacent portions of Bolivia, a small part of the Mato Grosso of Brazil, and nearly half of Paraguay.
Acacia caen also is common in the Central Valley of Chile in a number of natural ecosystems of both the semi-arid and subhumid portions of the Mediterranean-type climate of that country.
Ovalle et al. (1990) suggests that it is probably an invasive species in Chile that has become common by radical changes to the landscape brought about by European colonization.
Rarely, ants inhabit the spines of this species.
One specimen (Mereles 1130 from Paraguay) had a small hole near the tip of the spine.
The stipular spines on this specimen were more than 70 mm long and 10 mm wide at the base.
Fruit size and shape is highly variable (Spegazzini 1924).
Aronson (1992) recognized six varieties of A. caven based upon pod morphology (dehiscence, shape, size, mesocarp color and structure, and sutural ridges).
These include var. caven with elongated, dark brown pod 5-8 cm long, with one sutural ridge; var. macrocarpa Aronson with elongated, reddish purple pods more than 8 cm long, with three distinct sutural ridges; var. stenocarpa (Spegazzini) Burkart ex Cialdella with light brown, fusiform pods 3-4 cm long; var. microcarpa (Gpegazzini) Burkart ex Cialdella with subglobose pods 2-3 cm long by 1-1.5 cm wide, and a reddish mesocarp; var. sphaerocarpa Burkart ex Aronson with subglobose pods 2.16.5 cm long by 1.64.8 cm wide, and a white mesocarp; and var. dehiscens Burkart ex Cialdella with dehiscent pods.
No other morphological traits are consistently associated with the pod characteristics.
Baranelli et al. (1995) noted that the fruit are not always constant on a single tree.
Also, the geographic separation of these varieties, at the present, appears tenuous.
It is the opinion of the present authors that these variations in pod morphology are too variable to serve as a basis for distinguishing varieties.
Molina (1810) originally described this taxon from specimens found in central Chile, and considered it to be closely related to A. farnesiana.
These two species are superficially similar, and, as a result, some subsequent authors have merged the two taxa (Hassler 1909; Spegazzini 1924).
The two taxa are distinct, and, except for possibly in southeastern Brazil, are not sympatric.
Both species have inflated pods, short shoots with numerous small leaves, and similar flowers and inflorescences.
In A. farnesiana, the petiole has a small, circular gland that is raised above the petiolar groove, leaves with 2 to 6 pinna pairs, and the leaflets with obvious lateral veins.
Acacia caven, in contrast, has larger, elongated petiolar glands that are sessile in the petiolar groove, many of the leaves have more than 6 pinna pairs, and the leaflets lack obvious lateral veins.
Aronson and Nash (1989) found that a few herbarium specimens (5 of 40) released cyanide, whereas Aronson (1990) observed a slight cyanogenic reaction with some seedlings and mature trees of this taxon.
During the present study of the 158 herbarium specimens examined for hydrogen cyanide, nine were cyanogenic, five strongly so.
A taxon starts here.

Aronson and Nash (1989) have suggested that A. curvifructa is a hybrid between A. caven and A. farnesiana.
Present information suggests that A. farnesiana is not common in Argentina or Paraguay; being present as scattered introductions.
Acacia curvifructa is similar to A. farnesiana in that it has relatively large leaflets with obvious secondary venation; the structure of the petiolar gland, the puberulent petioles, rachis, and the short peduncles, however, suggest a relationship to A. caven.
The strongly curved fruits of A. curvifructa that are flattened to slightly elliptical in cross section and densely puberulent with a single row of seeds, are quite different from the mostly straight, glabrous, inflated fruits of A. caven, in which the seeds are in several rows and imbedded in a sweet pulp.
The puberulent leaflets, in which the secondary veins are obvious, also separate this species from A. caven.
Of the 25 specimens of this species examined for cyanogenic glycosides, none tested positive.

Acacia tortuosa is closely related to A. farnesiana; these taxa are sometimes considered conspecific.
In A. tortuosa, the fruits are relatively long (65-150 mm) and narrow (5-9 mm), densely pubescent, and constricted between the uniseriate seeds; while in A. farnesiana the fruits are shorter (30-90 mm), broader (10-18 mm), glabrous, and inflated with biseriate seeds.
Without fruits, consistent separation is still possible.
In A. fortuosa the twigs are strongly flexuous, the petioles, rachises, and spines are densely pubescent, the petioles, even on larger leaves, are 3-7 mm long, the leaflets are strongly ciliate, and the perianth lobes are puberulent.
In A. farnesiana, in contrast, the twigs are only slightly flexuous, the plants are usually glabrous to only lightly pubescent, the petioles are 4 to 17 mm long, the leaflets are not, or are only slightly ciliate, and the perianth lobes are commonly glabrous.
The petiolar glands of the smaller leaves of A. tortuosa, particularly those of the short shoots, are small and circular, similar to those in A. farnesiana, The leaves of rapidly growing branches of A. fortuosa, however, have petiolar glands that are much larger and usually elongated.
In the past, A. tortuosa has also been confused with A. schaffneri (Tumer 1959; Isely 1969), a taxon of northern Mexico.
The circular petiolar gland between the lower pinna pair in A. schaffneri consistently separates this species from A. tortuosa.
Clarke et al. (1989) found that nearly all specimens (95%) of this taxon from Central and North America were weakly cyanogenic.
Of the 75 specimens tested from South America, almost all (96%) gave a positive reaction, but the reaction was weak and slow to develop.
In some cases, living material of this species gives a rapid, positive reaction for cyanide.
