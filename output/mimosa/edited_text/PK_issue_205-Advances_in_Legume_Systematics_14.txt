Notes.
The current authors have not seen any specimens or specimen records from Cambodia (other than a single record in GBIF which is not from a preserved specimen), but Vidal and Hul Thol (1976) list Cambodia within the range for this species, citing two specimens from Kampot Province (Geoffray 62, 62 bis) and that information is retained here.
As these specimens could not be traced by the current authors, they are not included on the map.

Notes.
The current authors have not seen any specimens or specimen records from Hong Kong but the area is included within the distribution listed by Vidal and Hul 'Thol (1976) and that information is retained here.
The identity of the few available specimens from Laos and Myanmar is unconfirmed and these could be individuals of crista, although based on morphological affinities and the preference of T. crista for coastal habitats they are retained here as 7' sinensis pending further analysis of the species limits.

Notes.
Specimen Chen 0066 which is listed as a paratype of yunnanensis has leaflets that are asymmetrical, with an asymmetrical base and distinctly acuminate tip, and the secondary veins are at a more acute angle to the midvein when compared with typical T.- yunnanensis.
Itis sufficiently morphologically divergent from the yunnanensis to be considered by the current authors to represent a different taxon (not determined), and the characters of that specimen are therefore not included in the description above.

Brenan (1970, p. 28) and Ross (1974, p. 250; 1975a, p. 141) noted that leaf characters vary considerably across the range of E. elephantina.
Specimens from the western portion of the range tend to have fewer pinnae and leaflets with larger leaflets; those from eastern areas bear more numerous pinnae and leaflets, with smaller leaflets.
This variation appears to be continuous, so neither author attempted to subdivide the taxon.

Note.
The in the basionym Piptadenia? pervillei Vatke is associated with the genus Piptadenia and not with the species name pervillei because Vatke was not certain about the generic position of the species.
Entada pervillei var. genuina R. Vig. (i.e. equivalent to the typical variety var. pervillei) is a superfluous name because, once var. louvellii was moved to E. louvellii, the typical variety was effectively disbanded.

Habitat and ecology.
Woodland and grassland, often in rocky areas; 1050- 2130 m alt. Note.
Elephantorrhiza rangei Harms was treated as a distinct species by Ross (1975a), although with some hesitation because the species was known only from the type locality and displays considerable variation in leaflet size, even on a single branch.
Ross also noted that it "bears a superficial resemblance to Elephantorrhiza suffruticosa Schinz.
Plants of the World Online (POWO) places Elephantorrhiza rangei as a synonym of Elephantorrhiza suffruticosa Schinz, but when transferred to the genus Entada, the epithet suffruticosa cannot be used because the name Entada suffruticosa Vatke (1881, p. 108), for a Madagascan species (a synonym of Mimosa suffruticosa (Vatke) Drake), already exists.

Habitat and ecology.
In savannah and woodlands.
Note.
Ross (1975a, p. 148) noted that the above description of the flowers of E. schinziana comes from the second sheet of Dinter 1689, which Ross regarded as of potentially ambiguous identity given that "one of the [other two] sheets of Dinter 1689 is a mixed gathering of a vegetative shoot of E. suffruticosa and a pod of E. 'The flowering specimen on the second sheet is leafless, thus preventing a more definitive identification.
Ross conceded that "it is possible therefore that the flowers described are those of E. suffruticosa and not of E.

The protologue of Mimosa foetida ("crescit in India Occidentali.
In caldario floret Junio & suggests that Jacquin had the plant growing in a heated greenhouse in the gardens of Schénbrunn Palace.
However, it is not possible to know whether he based his description on a dried specimen from the Americas or on the plant cultivated in Vienna.
According to Stafleu and Cowan (1979), Jacquin "certainly made herbarium material of Austrian plants and plants in the gardens under his and they "are present in small numbers in a number of herbaria'.
His West Indies samples (which were acquired by Sir Joseph Banks), however, are very difficult to locate and it is not known if Jacquin made sizeable collections there; his specimens in the Banks herbarium (BM) are rare and consist of fragmentary specimens (Stafleu and Cowan 1979).
The origin of the seeds that arrived in Vienna is also questionable, as there are currently no records of the species occurring in the Antilles, and the seeds were most probably gathered in eastern Mexico.
We were unable to find any specimen that could be recognized as a type in the herbaria listed by Stafleu and Cowan (1979) and other collections, confirming Sousa and Andrade's (1992) previous searches ("holotipo W, no For this reason, we select the colored plate accompanying the description of the species as the lectotype of Mimosa foetida.
Based on variable features and a very small sample of South American plants, Sousa and Andrade (1992) recognized the NorthlCentral and South American disjunct populations of the genus as two subspecies (Fig. 7).
It is not our objective to evaluate infraspecific taxa, so we opted to maintain the circumscription of Microlobius foetidus as currently accepted.

0.5-2 mm long), leaflets inserted in opposite pairs (vs. alternate pairs), fruit a legume, valves dehiscing along both sutures (vs. fruit an indehiscent, nucoid legume or follicle).
The genus differs from Piptadenia in having unarmed branches (vs. armed branches in Piptadenia) and ferruginous granular trichomes on branches and leaves (vs. ferruginous granular trichomes absent).
Description.
Trees 8-30 m tall; branches unarmed, strongly striate, castaneous, apex yellow-tomentose and covered with ferruginous granular trichomes, not odoriferous.
Stipules caducous.

Fig. 3.
Geographic distribution and habitat.
Naiadendron is endemic to the Amazon rainforest, being recorded from the Brazilian states of Acre, Amazonas and Rondénia.
Tt grows on clay or sandy soil in ombrophilous and terra firme forests (Fig. 9).
Etymology.
The name Naiadendron celebrates the Amazon rainforest and the legacy of Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius (1794-1868), who named the Brazilian Amazon after the Naiads, Greek mythology's nymphs of freshwater.
Notes.
Strongly striate branches, a petiolar nectary 8-12 mm long, and the fruit a legume (valves dehiscing along both margins) are the main diagnostic morphological characteristics of Naiadendron.
Occhioni (1959) described Stryphnodendron duckeanum, based only on flowering specimens, and pointed out its morphological similarity to S. guianense.
However, both morphological (Scalon 2007; Lima et al. 2021; Scalon et al. 2022) and phylogenetic evidence (Simon et al. 2016; Ribeiro et al. 2018) have indicated that S. duckeanum should be recognized as an independent taxon, now named as the new genus Naiadendron.

Geographic distribution and habitat.
Stryphnodendron is a neotropical genus with its northern limit in Nicaragua and southern limit in the Brazilian state of Parana.
Stryphnodendron species occur in several vegetation types, and are especially frequent in savannas and in the Amazonian forest (Fig. 10).
Etymology.
The name Stryphnodendron comes from stryphnos- (adstringent) and dendron- (tree) and is a reference to the astringent properties of its tannin-rich bark.
Notes.
Stryphnodendron was first described by Martius (1837) based on three species: S. barbadetiman (Vell.) Mart., S. polyphyllum Mart. and S. rotundifolium Matt. 'The genus subsequently received a more detailed description and a broader circumscription by Bentham (1841, 1875, 1876), and currently comprises 28 species. 'The genus can be recognized by a suite of characters: unarmed branches, ferruginous granular trichomes on young shoots and leaves, caducous stipules, leaves with (3-)5-32 pairs of pinnae; leaflets 0.6-1.2 x 0.30.6 cm, inflorescence always a simple thyrse, and the fruit a nucoid (indehiscent) legume or follicle.
Stryphnodendron differs from Microlobius in having branches and leaves lacking a garlic odour (vs. branches and leaves with a strong garlic odour in Microlobius), leaves with (3-)5—32 pairs of pinnae (vs. leaves with 1—2 (—3) pairs of pinnae), alternate leaflets (vs. opposite leaflets), an extrafloral nectary present on the petiole (vs. extrafloral nectary absent on the petiole), brown or ochre seeds (vs. white seeds).
The morphological distinctiveness and diagnosability among Stryphnodendron, Gwilymia and Naiadendron are addressed above.

Habitat.
It grows in grasslands, scrubs and at the lower edge of the pine-oak belt, on both basaltic and calcareous substrates, at 1600-2800 m elev.
Plants ower between March and August.
Common names.
The common name is Huisache.
This name is also given to Vachellia farnesiana (L.) Wight & Arn. and other related species (Barneby and Grimes 1996).
Other common names are charrasquillo, gatufia and tehuixtle (Calderén de Rzedowski 2007).
Etymology.
The generic name honours Maria Lourdes Rico, whose profound dedication and perseverant commitment to botanical research over decades has deeply enhanced knowledge and understanding of the Leguminosae, especially tribe Ingeae.

1996).
Notes.
Albizia xerophytica was described from material from dry forest habitats in southern Honduras based on minor differences in leaf and fruit morphology, but we do not consider these to be significantly different from the range of variation that is observed in P adinocephala and prefer the broader concept of the species as described in Barneby and Grimes (1996: 218-220).
The difference in habitat (i.c., lower rainfall regions) also appears to be minor, as some specimens from wetter sites have been identified as A. xerophytica (see map in Rico Arce et al. 2008) while specimens of P adinocephala have been collected across the full range of drier and wetter sites.
Finally, the distribution of A. xerophytica is entirely enclosed by the much wider range of P adinocephala.

Fruits of this species are unknown and the species is only known from the type locality (Fig. 5), but it is similar in leaf and inflorescence morphology to several South American species of Psewdalbizzia, as described in the protologue.
Especially the efoliate pseudoracemes point to this species most likely being correctly accommodated in Pseudalbizzia.
Collection of fruits andlor inclusion of the species in phylogenetic studies is needed to confirm its generic and sectional placements.

Hydrochorea corymbosa occurs in periodically or permanently inundated riparian forest, gallery forest, and open vegetation, up to 480 m elevation (Barneby and Grimes 1996).
Notes.
Hydrochorea corymbosa is morphologically similar to H. gonggrijpii by its leaves with (2-)3-6 pairs of pinnae (3-5 pairs of pinnae in H. gonggrijpii), but differs by presenting (4—)5—11(—14) leaflet pairs per pinnae (vs. (12—-)14—35 in H. gonggrijpii).
Hydrochorea corymbosa has a wide distribution in the Brazilian Amazon, and displays wide morphological plasticity.
Barneby and Grimes (1996) recognised the specimen Louis Claude Richard s.n. (P02142909) as holotype, although the species protologue did not present a type specimen.
The specimen does represent original material that the author associated with the taxon, being a specimen collected by the author and annotated as Mimosa corymbosa.

Hydrochorea elegans has a morphological affinity with H. pedicellaris, as already pointed out by Ducke (1922) and by Barneby and Grimes (1996).
However, the corolla of peripheral flowers is larger (8-10 mm long) in H. elegans than in H. pedicelJaris (up to 7.5 mm long).
Ducke (1922) and Barneby and Grimes (1996) also commented on the similarity between the fruit of both species, but the fruits of H. elegans are indehiscent (vs. follicular dehiscence in H. pedicellaris).
Hydrochorea elegans has a disjunct distribution between hylaean Brazil and Costa Rica and Nicaragua.

Distribution and habitat.
Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico.
Hydrochorea leucocalyx occurs in wet tropical forests, often along riverbanks, seldom in anthropogenic pastures, up to 400 m elevation (Barneby and Grimes 1996).
Notes.
Amongst the species of Hydrochorea, H. leucocalyx is one of the few that does not occur in Amazonia.
It has affinities with the new species described in this treatment (see H. uaupensis) and is mainly distinguished by the lomentiform indehiscent fruit (vs. the cryptoloment in H. uaupensis).
Barneby and Grimes (1996) recognised the specimen J. N. Rovirosa 976 as holotype, but in the species protologue (Britton and Rose 1928), the authors did not indicate the herbarium where the type specimen was deposited.
Thus, following Art.
9.10 of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (Turland et al. 2018), the specimen J. N. Rovirosa 976 (US13198371) is here corrected to lectotype.

Distribution and habitat.
Brazil and Venezuela.
Hydrochorea marginata occurs in Amazonia, in flooded areas and along riverbanks and lake shores.
Notes.
Barneby and Grimes (1996) considered H. marginata to comprise three varieties, H. marginata var. panurensis (Benth.) Barneby & J.W.
Grimes, H. marginata var. scheryi Barneby & J.W.
Grimes, and Hydrochorea marginata var. marginata.
Hydrochorea marginata vat. panurensis is recognized at the species level in this treatment, and H. marginata var. scheryi is placed as a synonym of H. panurensis because we identified no morphological diagnostic characters that support them as independent taxa.
Both these taxonomic decisions are discussed under AL. panurenis.

Brazil, Venezuela.
Hydrochorea panurensis occurs in seasonally flooded Amazonian sites along rocky stream banks and ecotone with gallery forests.
Notes.
Ducke (1949) considered Pithecellobium panurense asa form of P marginatum, considering the vegetative characters to be more important taxonomically than the differences between the flowers of those taxa.
Barneby and Grimes (1996) moved P. panurense to Hydrochorea as H. marginata var. panurensis.
However, Hydrochorea panurense has diagnostic floral characters which distinguish it from H. marginata.
The floral buds of H. panurense have the corolla covered by the calyx; the flowers are glabrous and the terminal flower has a tubular calyx (vs. calyx not covering the corolla in the floral buds, pubescent flowers, and calyx of the terminal flower campanulate in H. marginata).
Barneby and Grimes (1996) also described H. marginata var. scheryi, distinguishing it from H. marginata var. panurensis only by the pedicel of the peripheral flowers, this 45 mm long. (vs.
6.5-13 mm long in H. marginata vat. panurensis).
Barneby and Grimes (1996) emphasized, however, that this is the only character to distinguish between the two taxa.
In the present study we consider Hi. marginata vax. scheryi to be a synonym of H. panurensis.
A second step lectotypification is designated here for both H. panurensis and H. marginata vat. scheryi, since the material that Barneby and Grimes (1996) recognised as holotypes consists of two sheets in both cases and they did not select lectotypes from amongst these sheets (Art.
9.10,9.17; Turland et al. 2018).

Distribution and habitat.
Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, Venezuela.
Hydrochorea pedicellaris occurs in non-inundated primary rainforest in Amazonia, in the lowlands of the Atlantic Rainforest, and in gallery forests, up to 200 m elevation, and occasionally at 700-800 m elevation in Bolivia, Ecuador and eastern Brazil (Barneby and Grimes 1996).
Notes.
Hydrochorea pedicellaris is the only species of the genus that occurs in a range of environments including areas of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.
It has an affinity with H. elegans (see comment under that species), but when it is in fruit it is easily recognized by its follicular dehiscence, and an exocarp with deep, transversal fissures.
Barneby and Grimes (1996) recognised a specimen in the G-DC herbarium as holotype, but in the species protologue (De Candolle 1825), the author did not indicate a type specimen.
Thus, the specimen at G-DC should be considered a lectotype, here corrected (Art.

Distribution and habitat.
Known from the tidal riverine systems near the coast from Senegal to Sierra Leone.
Hydrochorea rhombifolia occurs often abundantly, in permanent or tidal swamp forest, including on the edge of mangrove swamps, and in gallery forests.
Notes.
Bentham (1844) described Albizia rhombifolia, before designation of holotypes was required by the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature.
Keay (1953) made the new combination Cathormion rhombifolium and cited the holotype as being at Kew.
However, there are three specimens of Heudelot 735 at K, the type that was cited by Bentham, leaving it ambiguous as to which one of these represents the holotype.
Therefore, the specimen from Herbarium Benthamianum (the oldest deposited specimen dating to 1854) is here designated as a lectotype: it has leaves and flowers, and is more richly annotated than the other two specimens.
Hydrochorea obliquifoliolata and H. rhombifolia are morphologically very similar and have sometimes been confused in herbaria, despite their clearly different geodistributions.
The species are readily separated by the darker appearance of the leaflets of H. obliquifoliolata, which have a distinct shine on the upper surface and the lower surface usually (sub-)glabrous (vs. a usually rusty pilose lower leaflet surface in H. rhombifolia).
The leaflets of H. rhombifolia are also more closely spaced than those of H. obliquifoliolata, the latter not having overlapping margins.
Furthermore, the flower colour of the two species is clearly different (as per the key), a characteristic which remains apparent when comparing dried flowering specimens in the herbarium, and the corolla lobes of H. obliquifoliolata are glabrous or with a few short apical hairs (vs. pilose to villous on the upper half in H. rhombifolia).

Distribution and habitat.
Brazil.
Known only from the Upper Rio Negro region in the Brazilian Amazon (Amazonas state), in seasonally inundated "campinarana' vegetation.
Phenology.
Flowering and fruiting in July.
Etymology. 'The specific epithet refers to the type locality, near the River Uaupés, in the state of Amazonas, Brazil.
The indigenous people living in this area (e.g., the Tucanos) were known as Uaupés, and later the river took the same name.
Notes.
Hydrochorea uaupensis is only known from Amazonas state, Brazil, where it was collected at "Igarapé in the municipality of Sao Gabriel da Cachoeira, during fieldwork in July 2012.
The species grows in open vegetation on white sand, known in Brazil as campinarana in the Amazon Domain.
During times of flood, only the treetops are exposed above the water line.
A second herbarium collection from close to the type locality (Rio Touri, afl. do Rio Negro, igap; RL.
Frdes 28691, IAN [IAN78279]), of which we have only seen an image, is here tentatively included under H. waupensis because the fruit and leaves match the type material and the flowers are described as pink on the specimen label.
Since these two occurrence records are close to the borders with Colombia and Venezuela, the species is to be expected in those two countries. 'The phylogenetic position of H. uaupensis, as the sister lineage of the clade composed of Hydrochorea sensu Barneby and Grimes (1996) and the African Hydrochorea spp., provides ample support for this as a distinct taxon and a species new to science, as it does not forma sister pair with any other known species.
Furthermore, this phylogenetic position is in line with the fruit morphology of the species being intermediate between Balizia and Hydrochorea, adding further support, along with the paraphyly of Balizia, for not maintaining these as distinct genera.
Conservation status.
Data deficient.
The species is known only from two adjacent localities in the Upper Rio Negro region of Amazonas state, Brazil.
More collections are needed to assess the species' conservation status.

Notes.
A specimen seen at Kew, of Espirito Santo 1858, collected in GuinéeBissau, is doubtfully placed in this species.
This specimen is highly unusual in the number of pairs of pinnae (13) and leaflet pairs (14-35) and the leaflets appear relatively small and elongate (even though they appear not fully expanded), while having the typical asymmetrical hastate shape.
Furthermore, the fruit is not clearly articulate and also differs in being only somewhat curved rather than twisted or coiled.
Brenan and Brummitt (1965) also cited this material as being unusual and speculated that it may be a distinct taxon.
I do not share this opinion as I do not think it is sufficiently morphologically distinct.
It is perhaps more likely of hybrid origin with O. dinklagei, which occurs sympatrically, as the other parent.
However, this unusual specimen resembles O. altissimum much more closely than O. dinklagei and the number of pinnae and leaflets and dimensions of the leaflets clearly distinguish it from that species.
The holotype of Pithecellobium stuhlmannii was destroyed at B and no surviving isotypes are known.
According to the Flora of East Tropical Africa (Brenan 1959), the original material was collected in the Democratic Republic of Congo, west of Lake Albert.
The specimen of Bequaert 4887 from BR is from the same region, includes leaves, flowers and immature fruit and matches the description in the protologue and is here selected as the neotype of P stuhlmannii. 'The holotype of Albizia passargei was also destroyed at B, but Villiers (1989) placed the name in synonymy with C. altissimum, based on the description in the protologue.
A specimen of Letouzey 2562 from P, comprising leaves and flowers, is here chosen as the neotype as it was collected in N Cameroon (ca. 150 km SW of the type locality) and matches the description in the protologue.

Note.
This subspecies was originally described as an infraspecific variety.
I have considered treating it as a distinct species, but after studying material held at BR, I concluded it cannot be reliably separated from the typical subspecies across its entire range.
The material stands out in its combination of slightly different leaf shape and smaller pods, but material outside the Busira river catchment in the Democratic Republic of Congo, as well as in other parts of Africa, is rather variable in leaf shape and pod size.
Given that both these differences are consistently present in most of the material from that region, i.e. the variation is geographically structured within this variable and widespread species, subspecies is more appropriate than varietal rank and I treat it here as such.

Capitula 2-4 arranged in fascicles, on peduncles ca. 2.7-4.5 cm, dimorphic with ca. 50-70 peripheral flowers and a single elongated central flower.
Bracteoles spatulate, ca. 0.5 mm long, pubescent on outer surface.
Flowers white, the peripheral ones on pedicels 0.75—2.5 mm.
Calyx slenderly campanulate, green, 5-merous, 2-2.5 mm long, densely puberulous on outer surface, the deltoid lobes ca. 0.25 mm long, corolla 4-4.5 mm long, pubescent on outer surface, the lobes 1.8-2 mm long, stamens 10-14, the filaments white, 11-14 mm long, basally fused into a tube 1.5-2.5 mm long, anthers basifixed, pollen released in 32-celled polyads, pistil on a ca. 0,25-0.75(-1.25) mm long stipe, ovary ca. 1-1.5 mm long, pubescent, style 12-16 mm long, stigma shallowly funnel-shaped.
Central flower(s) similar to peripheral flowers, but sessile and longer, calyx ca. 2.5 mm long, corolla ca. 6-6.5 mm long, staminal tube 4-6 mm long, exserted beyond corolla tube.
Fruit a dark brown to black indehiscent pod that may tardily disintegrate into 1—-multiple-seeded parts, the slightly thickened margins usually straight or also often articulate especially around aborted seeds, the valves papery and thin or with somewhat thickened mesocarp, but not really ligneous, when ripe, swollen over the seeds, when well-fertilised, 12-28 (—32)-seeded, (4.5-)10-16(—20) x 0.9-1.3 x 0.4-0.7 cm.
Seeds yellowish-brown, 5.5—7.5 x 3-4.5 x 2-3 mm with hard testa and a darker closed pleurogram of 4.5—5.5 x 1.2-1.5 mm.

Notes.
Osodendron leptophylla is highly variable in number of pinnae per leaf, number and size of leaflets and density and length of the indumentum.
No consistent correlations between any of these variations have been found suggesting that the material referred to two heterotypic synonyms is best included under O. leptophyllum.
The first of these is Albizia eriorhachis, described by Harms in the same publication as A. leptophylla.
Specimens from Cameroon, Central African Republic and Gabon, identified as Cathormion eriorhachis, appear to be similar to typical O. leptophyllum, but with relatively large leaflets and denser indumentum.
However, the material is not distinct enough to merit recognition as a separate species, given the large variation in leaf dimensions and indumentum in O. leptophyllum across its range and is here placed in its synonymy.
The second is Samanea guineensis, which was originally described as a variety of Arthrosamanea leptophylla, based on more numerous pairs of pinnae and leaflets per leaf, but Brenan and Brummitt (1965) found it to be distinctive enough to recognise it at species rank.
Apart from the difference in foliage, they noted differences in the indumentum of the calyx and corolla (glabrous to subglabrous, instead of densely puberulent) and a longer exserted staminal tube.
I have observed material that fits their observations (e.g. Jean Louis 10051, BR), but in other collections with the leaf type of I have observed dense pubescence on the calyx (e.g. Michelson 877, BR) and vice versa specimens with ca. 15 pairs of pinnae and a subglabrous calyx (Letouzey 9816).
Villiers (1989) also judged S. guineensis to be conspecific with S. leptoplylla, having also seen numerous specimens with intermediate foliage.
I follow Villiers (1989) and place this name in the synonymy of O. leptophyllum.
