X-XII, IV. Uribe recognized the relationship between C. matisiana and C. tolimensis, but distinguished C. manstana by the pedicellate flower, more numerous pinnae and leaflets, and flowers said to be more than three times larger.
The population at Guaduas has indeed on average slightly more numerous leaflets, but genuine C. tolimensis, now known by several collections from Huila, also has pedicellate flowers, and the difference in flower-size was simply a mistake.
The fruits of C. matisiana are pilosulous with prevailingly short rustybrown hairs, whereas those of C. tolimensis elsewhere are clothed in longer, largely white ones.
This visually arresting difference in pubescence is the one distinctive character of C. matisiana, which I here regard as a somewhat aberrant population that does not deserve taxonomic rank.

Caltiandra bijuga closely resembles the allopatric C. rubescens and C. goldmanii, but differs from both in somewhat lower leaf-formula and dark crimson androecium, from C. rubescens further in larger leaflets and from C. goldmanit further in less condensed brachyblasts and few-nerved stipules.
The equation C. bijuga = C. michelsi, proposed first by Micheli and lately endorsed by McVaugh, is here accepted without question.
Collectors have described the androecium as either uniformly comson or white with rose-pink tassel.

As described above, C. Airsuta is uncomfortably polymorphic, and may consist of several discrete taxa or geographic races.
Features common to these are relatively smal] stature, bright red flowers of moderate size, red androecia, and habitat in the pine-oak belt of southern Mexico.
Typical C. Airsusa, which has been collected repeatedly in central Oaxaca, has leaf-formulae of (iii—jiv—vi(—vii)/17-28, and is densely loosely pilose throughout.
Named segregates listed in the synonymy above are weakly characterized as follows: a.
Calliandra nitida S. Wats., from vicinity of Guadalajara, Jalisco: leaf-formula (v—)vii-xi (-xiii)/28-35, leaves (except for ventral face of leaflets) and flowers densely loosely villouspilosulous. b.
Anneslia diquetii Britton & Rose, from western Jalisco: leaf-formula iv—vii/28-32; leaflets dorsally subappressed-pilosulous. c. pubiflora Britton & Rose, from Chiapas: leaf-formula vii—viii/34; leaflets thinly subappressed-pilosulous, but perianth denseiy loosely so. d.
Anneslia houghiana Britton & Rose, described from Puebla as having leaf-formula of 6-16," in reality has vi—vii/26; it is not different in either number or indumentum of leaflets from the typical form as interpreted above. e. Pithecellobium siltepecense Lundell, from Chiapas: leaf-formula v—vi/23-25, leaflets glabrous dorsally, thinly ciliolate; perianth thinly appressedpilosulous.
The transfer of this taxon to Cojoba, proposed by L. Rico, is incomprehensible.
A previously undescribed variant from central Oaxaca (Hughes 1503, NY) has leaf-formula of vii— viii/22-28, but leaflets and perianth only thinly strigulose, the foliage in consequence bright green rather than cinereous.

Calliandra peninsularis is notable for indecisive phyllotaxy, elaborately decompound leaves, and relatively thin-textured pod.
It differs from C. catifornica, which is found in the same latitude but in desert foothills below 550 m, in more numerous pinnae and leaflets.
The glandular indumentum ascribed to C. peninsufaris by Wiggins consists of small, thickened multicellular, so-called granufar trichomes common in the genus, in this case mixed with simple hairs.

Calliandra californica is obviously related to C. eriophylla, from which Britton & Rose (1928: 50, key) separated it by the feeble and ineffective character of leaflets 4-6 (not 3-4) mm long. Its imperfectly distichous phyllotaxy, filaments crimson-scariet their whole length, flowers slightly more numerous per capitulum, perianth a bit longer (5.5-7.2, not 3.4-5.5 mm), and allopatric dispersal are stronger, but not very strong supporting differences, and a case for demoting one or the other to varietal rank could be made.
Unfortunately, if this were proposed, priority would require C. californica, published in midJanuary 1844, to retain specific rank and C. eriomuch more widely used and published on February 1 of the same year, to be subordinated.
I gladly 'eave the decision in other hands.
For a species of relatively narrow range (Map 8) and uniform desert ecology, C. californica is surprisingly variable in leaf-formula and indumentum.
These modes of variation, however, are correlated neither with one another nor with dispersal.
Extreme variants, such as Hughes 1546 (NY). which has relatively few and ample, glabrous leaflets and completely hairless perianth, and Nelson & Goldman 7411 (NY), which has many small, dorsally silky leaflets and hairy perianth, are instantly perceived as different.
Both are from the Cape region and each is connected by intermediates with genuine C. californica from Magdalena Bay and with the taxonomically negligible Annestia mixta and A. mucronulata.
The former, the closely similar Wiggins 5675 (NY), both from near Miraflores, and Lehto 19671 (NY) from cultivation in Arizona, together suggest passage into the related C. peninsularis, found close at hand but at greater elevations (in the oak-pine belt) in Sierra de Victoria.

Calliandra eriophytia, the one species of its genus common in the northem Sonoran and Chihuahuan deserts, with disjunct populations further south, is difficult to characterize neatly, because of marked seasonal dimorphism of the foliage.
Plants bearing many, relatively large, primary leaves, in vigorous spring growth, are deceptively different from those flowering from brachyblasts after the ephemeral primary leaves have been shed.
The species is closely akin to the vicariant, but less widely dispersed C. conferta, C. californica, and C. biftora, which see for commentary on differentia) characters.
According to Benson and Darrow (1954: 1.c.) the plants furnish excellent browse and can regenerate by suckering, Despite distracting random variation in leaf-formula and size of flowers, only one morphologically weak variety is taxonomically recognizable.
With misgiving I refer to var. eriophylfa two collections from Sonora (VanDevender 92-227; H. S. Gentry 1281, both NY) that differ in relatively ample leaves to 3-5.5 em, pinna-rachises to 2-3.5 cm) and more numerous (28-38, not 16-27) filaments.
The specimens, both gathered in February, are in poor condition and may Tepresent a distinct taxon,

In the short span of time between 1838 and 1853, botanists independently described as species four taxa that in recent years have been combined with good reason into one, taxonomically complex C. sens. lat. Two of these were encountered by European travelers at the south margin of the Mexican Plateau, in Hidalgo and Zacatecas, and were described in Europe.
The twa others were based by Engelmann and Asa Gray on collections of August Fendler and Charles Wright from New Mexico.
Bentham (1875) perceived that only two substantial taxa, C. Asunilis and C. reticulata could be maintained, but as new Material accumulated, from both southwestern United States and Mexico, these also proved to be geographically and morphologically confluent.
Modem analysts (Benson, Isely, McVaugh) of the complex are unanimous in recognizing one species composed of two varieties differing ideally in amplitude of leaflets, and some more trifling characters, but propose somewhat different definitions of these.
Isely (1973) proposed for var. reticuiata in United States a leaf-formula of i-ii(-iii)/S5—6(-8) coinciding with leaflets 5-10(-12) mm long, in contrast to leafformula iii—vifé-14(-20) in var. humilis, coinciding with leaflets 3-5 mm long. It is disconcerting to find in an isotype of C. reticulata (NY) pinnae bearing 11, 12, even 14 pairs of leaflets, In fact, leaf-formulae overlap between plants with relatively ample and distant, as opposed to small and crowded, leaflets.
Supporting differential characters that have been sought in density of pubescence, prominence of yenulation, and length of peduncles are all now known to vary independently and continuously, without any strong correlation with dispersal, for the range of var. reticulata is almost fully contained within that of var. Aumitis.
Nevertheless the extreme forms of var. reticulata are instantly recognizable.
With their relatively low leaf-formula and especially with their larger, more prominently venulose leaflets are generally associated a condensed, even subacaulescent growth-habit, indumentam sparse or almost lacking, and capitula consistently sessile.
The taxon reticulata may perhaps consist of neotenous variants of var. Aumilis that have arisen independently from the matrix of the species, Its strange, partiy sympatric, partly vicariant dispersal within the whole range of C. would harmonize with such a hypothesis.
Granted the significance of leaf-formula in separating vars. humilis and reticulata, it becomes necessary to recognize further a new variety, gentryana, which differs in yet more elaborately decompound leafblades and a vicariant dispersal on the west slope of Sa. Madre Occidental.
Calliandra hwnilis ranges further north than any other member of the genus, in Arizona north to the Coconino Plateau and in New Mexico to the upper Pecos valley in latitude 35°30'N, where it must survive frigid winter temperatures.
The key that follows will discriminate between most collections of var. humilis and var. reticulata, but abstinately individual specimens must be expected.

II, V-IX, XI, perhaps intermittently through the year.
Because of seasonal dimorphism of the foliage and the appearance of flowers associated either with primary leaves or, after their fall, on brachyblasts lateral to defoliate stems, the specimens here referred to C. taxifolia are superficially diverse.
In addition to seasonal yariation in foliage, they demonstrate a clinal north-south variation in venulation of leaflets and in prominence of nerves on the calyx.
However, have found no discrete taxa.
The typus of C. taxtfolia has only conjugately pinnate leaves and distinctly venulose leaflets; but Hitchcock 2/324 (NY), from a few kilometers west of Loja, has the same leaflets on primary leaves with up to three pairs of pinnae.
The collections from Mollendo, interpreted by Macbride (1943) as C. prostrata, seem morphologically insepatable, except perhaps for flower color, said (Dillon 3936, NY) to be orange or (Worth & Morison 15748, GH) orange-red, rather than simply red as in Ecuador and most of Peru.
Macbride (1943; 71) described the flower of his collection from Ambo in Hudauco, identified as C. expansa, as "very deep and bright but this may perhaps refer only to the perianth, and not to the freshy expanded androecium.

As might be foreseen from the synonymy cited above, C. parvifolia varies considerably in features of which the importance has been exaggerated: leafformula, pubescence (especially of the fruit), length of peripheral pedicels, flower-size, and number of stamens.
Bentham acknowledged close similarity between C. bicolor (an admitted synonym, now untenable, of C. parvifolia), C. myriophytia, C. peckolat, and C. microphylla, but noted these particularities (see his conspectus of Calliandra, Bentham, 1876: 408) of each: in C. bicolor only 3-6 pairs of pinnae; in the rest 10-20 pinna pairs coupled in C. myriophylla with densely pubescent young foliage and scarcely pedicelled flowers about 6 mm long, in C. microphytia with glabrescent leaves and sessile flowers about 4 mm long, and in C. peckoltit with glabrous leaves and pedicellate flowers 4 mm long. The fruit of C. biceior was pubescent, that of C. myriophyila glabrous, and that of C. microphylla facially pubescent but marginally glabrous.
In material now available for comparison, the leaf-formula, leafpubescence, and flower-size are independently and continuously variable, and I have found no credible geographical or morphological patterns in them.
Vesture of the fruits needs further study, for few have been collected, and the ovary at anthesis is always glabrous, acquiring vesture only after fertilization.
There are trends toward higher leaf-formula and longer pedicels in Brazil northward from state of Rio de Janeiro, and these are accompanied by slightly shorter and sometimes narrower calyx; whereas from central Goids to Paraguay and Argentina the pedicels are often (but not in fact always) shorter and the corolla a trifle longer, but not in concert with pinnaor leaflet-number.
1 evaluate C. microcalyx, a name taken up by Renvoize (1981) for the Bakian forms of C. parvifotia, as essentially equivalent to C. peckoltit though the leaflets are a little fewer.
Leaflet-number is, however, quite variable between leaves of primary and these of short-shoots, which may be the only leaves present at flowering time.
I have found, in addition, that the androecium in plants that approximate the C. peckolttimicrocalyx form is commonly less than 20-merus as contrasted with 20—-32-merous elsewhere in the species.
It might in consequence be possible to recognize in C. parviflora two varieties divided approximately by the 45th meridian (see Map 12), but certainly not more than one independent species.
The altitudinal range of C. parvifolia is notable.
It is assumed that the riparian populations along the lower Uruguai and Paraguai rivers are colonists from further north, where precisely similar forms occur at elevations up to 650 m.
In Bahia C. parvifolia is well known from elevations of 900 m upward in Chapada Diamantina and recurs, somewhat surprisingly, on dunes of the Atlantic coast north of Salvador.
The gedicels in this coastal form are exceptionally long (to 4.5 mm, Queiroz 2534, HUEFS).

A polymorphic species of wide dispersal over the Brazilian Planalto, in campo cerrado and campo rupestre upward of 500 m, extending from extreme s. Piauf s. to extreme n.
Parand, w. just into Paraguay, the range more exactly described under each variety.
The foregoing description of C. dysantha records the presently known macromorphological variation in a complex species that includes not only the original C. dysantha as conceived by Bentham but also his species abbreviata, macrocephala, and turbinata, and furthermore several minor variants that were not yet known in 1875-1876.
Bentham's four major species were placed close together in a subordinate group within ser. Nitidae, within which they were separated by combinations of three characters: number of pinnae per leaf; length of peduncles, and mutual proportions of calyx and corolla.
These formulae are no longer applicable to much of the material that has accumulated in herbaria subsequently. 'The commonest, most widely dispersed, and consequently best known member of this group, C. dysantha sens. str., was defined by 4-6 pairs of pinnae, subsessile capitula, and corolla more than twice as long as calyx.
Copious collections from the relatively restricted territory of the Brazilian Distrito Federal now show pinnae in three to seven, even nine pairs, peduncles indeed often obsolete or almost so but the first of each stem not seldom developed (to 1.5, exceptionally 2 cm), and calyx often half or more than half as long as corolla, The free filaments are constantly blood-red. abbreviata was described from a depauperate specimen with only two pairs of pinnae in the few remaining leaves, though the description was soon modified to three pairs seen on the isotype in Hooker's herbarium (K!) and on a second collection (Gardner 2835, K!) from northwestern Bahia.
A modern collection from nearly the same place (Coradin 3775, otherwise identical, has four pairs, and is indistinguishable from some C. dysantha of Goids and Minas Gerais.
Calfiandra abbreviata is confidently equated taxonomically with typical C. dysantha.
Most capitula of C. dysansha var. dysantha arise from brachyblasts on 1-3 efoliate nodes axillary to a primary leaf—that is, on axes of the second order— and are huddled together toward the stem's apex on obsolescent but bracteolate peduncles, the filamenttassel is uniformly and consistently red.
By contrast, the capitula of C. macrocephala ate borne on extended ebracteolate peduncles that arise directly from well-spaced primary leaves, from mid-stem upward; and the tassel, so far as known, is never red, but pink white-tipped, or pink at each end and whitish in between.
Against these rather striking differences are marshalled similarity in leaves, capitula, individual flowers, and tornentose pod, pointing to a very close telationship, expressed at the varietal rank. turbinata, also here interpreted as a variety of C. dysantha, was at first assigned 8-12 pairs of pinnae, short but evident peduncles, and a corolla scarcely half as long as the calyx.
It is now certain that leaf-formula alone does not separate C. turbinata from var. dysantha, but the notably short and narrow leaflets, the distinctly pedicelled peripheral flowers, and the whitish androecium constitute a strong diagnostic syndrome.
Calliandra turbinata (which includes the inconsiderable C. chapadae) might be maintained as in independent species except that we now have plants, described below as C. dysantha vat. opulenta, in which the foliage of normal var. dysantha coincides not only with the pedunculate capitula and pink-white tassel of var. macrocephata but with the pedicellate peripheral flowers of C. turbinata.
A practical advantage of amalgamating these taxa into one specific unit is that C. dysantha sens. lat, becomes definable by wide discontinuities on ail sides from related species.
Here must be mentioned an ambiguous specimen from the eastern edge of the range of C. dysantha in Bahia (5 km s. of Caieteté, Harley 2/096A, K).
It closely resembles some small-leaflet forms of var. dysantha in all respects but two: the calyx (disregarding pedicel) is only about 2.5 mm tong, and the filaments are described as white pink-tipped.
Possibly this may represent a hybrid derivative of C. dysantha and C. nebulosa, which has been collected within two kilometers along the road south of Caieteté.

The var. dysantha is variable in width of leaflets: the narrow and broad extremes appear very different, and are to some degree correlated with dispersal.
In Goidas and Distrito Federal the larger leaflets are almost consistently (3.5-)4-6.5(-7) mm wide, in Bahia and Minas Gerais they are mostly commonly 2-3.5 mum wide.
However, the apparent gap between the extremes is bridged in Minas Gerais by leaflets 2.5-6 mm wide (in mun. Gouveia) and 2-4 mm wide (Sa. do Cipéd), and on Chapada des Veadieros in Goids by jeaflets 3-5 mm wide.
Fnitescent forms, in which the new stem regenerates from apex of the past year's growth rather than from the rootstock, are found most frequently in trans-Franciscan Bahia and may be genetically determined, but their flowering branches are not distinguishable from the whole annual growth of the more common forms.
In the same general region, the flowers tend to be a trifle smaller than on the Goids highlands, but not discontinuously so.

The isotypus is dated March 1817, 14 years prior to Luschnath's arrival in Brazil, and was probably collected by Prince Maximilian.
According to Urban's itinerary (1906: 144), Maximilian passed through a Campos Gerais, northwest of Vitoria da Conquista, in the first quarter of 1817, but the term is perhaps topographic rather than toponymic.

The broadly drawn definition of C. surinamensis proposed herewith may come as a surprise to those familiar with the traditional taxonomy, in which C. tenuiflora has invariably been accepted as a distinct taxon.
As first known to Bentham (1875: 547), C. tenuiflora differed from C. surinamensis, as then known, in having 5—6 rather than 8-12 pairs of leaflets per pinna, the largest of them >2 cm, as opposed to <1.5 cm, in length.
No substantial difference in the inflorescence or the individual flower was then known, and both species were described from Pard.
Subsequently C. (sens. str.) has been considered (Irwin, 1966: 97) closer to C. purpurea, and its affinity to C. surinamensis has been lost sight of.
Specimens from the whole vast range of C. surinamensis now demonstrate a continuous series of variants in number and size of leaflets that has erased the supposed discontinuity between it and C. tenuiflora.
As a rule, relatively numerous leaflets are relatively small and fewer leaflets larger, and the furthest pair either is or may be largest of all in both cases.
Whether few or many, the leaflets vary in outline from narrowly lanceolate to obtusely rhombic.
Plurifoliolate forms of C. surinamensis ate distributed over the species range, from the Guianas and lower Amazonian Brazi! west to Colombia and Peru, whereas the paucifoliolate ones are scattered along the Amazon and tributaries from Pard aimost to the Peruvian border and north through the Guianas to Venezuelan Guyana, without establishing any independent area of dispersal, The variable development of the androecial tube, as described above, is linked neither with leaf-formula nor with geographic dispersal.

Calliandra samik closely resembles the polymorphic C. surinamensis in foliage and indumentum and may prove to be merely another extreme variant of it.
However, the much longer perianth (for measurements see the Latin diagnosis above) can hardly be accommodated in my present concept of C. surinamensis.

Leaflet size and leaflet number vary considerably between populations of C. purpurea on the Lesser Antilles and between those scattered along the Caribbean slope in Venezuela and Colombia.
The following numbers of leaflet-pairs (per pinna of primary leaves) are on record: Antigua: 5; Montserrat and Guadeloupe: Martinique, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and the Grenadines: mostly 3—4, rarely 6; northern Venezuela: (2-)3, 4, or 5; northem Colombia: 4-7.
Plumier's drawing, which furnished the Linnaean protologue, shows 3 and 4 pairs; the model very likely came from Martinique, as did that of var. dussiana, which is essentially typicat C. purpurea.
The populations with 6-8 pairs of leaflets on Montserrat and Guadeloupe correspond with var. quenitiniana, and are mildly distinctive; however, 6-7 pairs recur in Magdalena, Colombia.
Calliandra slaneae, with 3-4 pairs, is interpreted as the xeromorphic extreme from arid insular habitats.
Venezuelan C. obmsifolia (from Sucre) and C. coroénsis (from Falcén), with respectively 4-6 and (2-)3 pairs of leaflets per pinna, were long ago equated with C. purpurea by Bentham.
The geographically remote population in Guyana (A. C. Smith 3468, K, NY) was identified as C. purpurea by Sandwith and appears at very most varietally distinct from Caribbean C. purpurea in slightly larger flowers.
Finally, size of and pubescence of leaflets are randomly correlated with dispersal and offer no firm basis for segregation.

In 70 years since its discovery C. riparia has acquired no substantial identity in the literature, but is nevertheless one of the commoner unijugate calliandras in seasonally dry parts of northern South America, moreover it is widely cultivated both in its native range and elsewhere, but where cultivated passing as C. surinamensts, It does indeed resemble forms of polymorphic C. surinamensis that have about 7-1] pairs of leaflets per pinna, but these leaflets are linear or lineat-elliptic rather than rhombic or oblong.
The hard sced-coat, lacking pleurogram, provides the decisive differential character.
The pre-colonial distribution of C. riparia, before it was taken into parks and gardens, seems to have centered in the Orinoco valley between Zulia and Boliyar, reaching the Pakaraima mountains in Guyana and extending westward through the Caribbean lowlands of Colombia to Chocé and to easter Panama.
Beyond this range there are records from Trinidad, Atlantic Guyana, one each from Honduras and Costa Rica, many from inter-Andean Colombia, and from further afield, all probably or certainly taken from ormamental plantings.
As native status is seldom noted on herbarium labels, it is not possible to distinguish between aboriginal and subsequent status, even in Venezuela.
The accompanying map records all known occurrences of C. riparia in the Americas.
The remarks by Skutch (Brenesia 37: 141-143, fig. 1) on floral dimorphism and phenology of C. surinamensis cultivated at General, Costa Rica, are perhaps applicable to C. riparia,

In the context of the Bolivian flora and the sect. Androcallis, C. chulwmania is quickly identified by a leaf-formula of i/7-9, softly pilosulous leaflets, relatively short peduncles, and deep red tassel of filaments.

The largely Hylacan C. surinamensis can have similar Jeaf-formula, but is not known from Bolivia and bas no pleurogram on the seed-coat.
At kilometer 30 on the Chulumani-Asunta road, Beck collected both typical C. chulumania (no. 42166, NY) and an anomalous plant (no. 72/62, NY) different in longer petioles (to 10-16 mm), leaflets to 10 pairs per pinna, and facially glabrous (but ciliate) leaflets; its status is not determined, but it could be ejther juvenile or a shade-form.

In the protologue C. carcerea was described as resembling Antillean C. purpurea, but more densely pubescent.
This is not universally true, and it is likely that C. carcerea, when better known, will prove to be an outlying disjunct form of C. purpurea sens. lat., different if at all in slightly longer pinnae and slightly more numerous leaflets.
The epithet carcerea (of prison) is unexplained.
I conjecture it may be a misreading of cafcarea (of limestone) and allude to the town of Calera (lime pit) near which the species was discovered.

Coahuila (Sa, de Jardin), Mexico. — Map 26. — Fl. IV—VI, sporadically later, following rains, Calliandra conferta closely resembles C. ertophylla in most resepcts, and is easily mistaken for droughtstressed aspects of C. eriophyila which have lost the primary leaves and retain only the simpler brachyblast leaves, many or most of which may consist of only one pair of pinnae.
Byen these, however, have a longer primary axis.
Further differential characters of C. conferta are the shorter androecium (7.5-14, not 16-27 mm long), paler pink or whitish filaments and on the average shorter, thinner-textured pods with narrower sutural ribs.
An intrastaminal nectary is found at the base of almost every flower of C. eriobut has not been seen in any flower of C. conSerta.
These relatively weak differences, in context of an almost perfectly vicariant dispersal, would seem to justify the reduction of C. conferta to varietal status, as evidently contemplated (in annotation of specimens, NY) by Isely.
The complete subordination of C. conferta, in North American Flora, is, on the other hand, clearly mistaken.

Calandra brevipes, commonly passing under the misnomer C. sefloi, might stand as the prototype of the conjugately pinnate, plurifoliolate species of sect. Androcaliis.
It was cultivated at Kew in 1850 (K, NY), on Martinique in 1857 (Bélanger 297, 1046, both G), at Hortus Bogoriensis in 1903 (NY) and is currently planted in gardens of Dominican Republic.
Its many small, almost veinless leaflets and its starbursts of bicolored filaments arising from parallel ranks of brachyblasts are unquestionably ormamental.
For purposes of nomenclature I have ignored Acacia sellot Sprengel, which Macbride interpreted as the basionym of Calliandra selloi.
No typus of A. selfot is known to survive, and the leaflet number ascribed to the species is much lower than seen in any collection of C. brevipes.
The typus of C. yucunensis has not been seen, but there is nothing in the protologue incompatible with other examples of C. brevipes from Rio Grande do Sul.

This rare species, not collected in the past century, has much in common with C. brevipes, but it seems nevertheless distinct in larger stipules and leaflets, in deeper calyx, in teumpetlike androecium of the terminal flower of capitula, and in densely pilosulous, not glabrous pod.
The type-collections of Munosa staminea and Calliandra cinerea were collected in the same segment of Sa. do Espinhago, a region noted for Iccal endemism, and their protologues are in close agreement.
Whatever the status of the species, these two names are sure to remain taxonomic synonyms.

Eastern Brazil in lat. 3°30'—18°S: best known from Chapada Diamantina in Bahia and the upper S. Francisco Basin in Minas Gerais, where found in campo cerrado and campo rupestre, mostly between 600 and 1200 m; recorded once from the Ilha de Balsas in Maranhao, in chapadao at 300 m; once from Piaui (Sa. da Lagéa, not located, not mapped) and callected several times in the lower Tocantins Valley near Tucuruf Reservoir, on white sand campirana at 70 m. — Map 28. — FI.
Calliandra sessilis can be recognized, in the context of sect. Androcailis, by unijugate pinnae, sessile or subsessile capitula, and oblique rootstocks which give fise to stoloniferous thickets.
Flowering stems commonly arise directly from the rhizome, but sometimes persist as slender woody tnunks.
The relatively uncommon fruticose form has been found in Bahia (Harley 19978, NY) and in Par (Lisboa 1252, NY), in both cases close to the diffuse rhizomatous, functionally herbaceous form.
No differences in leaf or in individual flower are correlated with the variations in stature, and the growth-forms seem to be no more than aspects of one variable species.
There is some variation among specimens in length of the floriferous brachybtasts, C. axillaris sens, str. being the state in which one or two capitula are borne together on a very short or even obsecure branchlet axillary to a coeval leaf, whereas C. Sessilis sens. str. is the state in which the capitula arise from near apex of an older brachyblast thatched with closely imbricate, defoliate stipules.
Harley recorded the flowers of his no. 15978 as intensely fragrant.

Calfiandra pauciflora is the one species of its genus armed with truly spinescent stipules, though only those stipules that subtend primary leaves of long-shoots are thus modified, not those of the floriferous brachyblasts.
In general habit the species resembles the sympatric Sphinga prehensilis (C. Wright) Bameby & Grimes, but has much shorter rianth and androecia! tube and, of course, the fruit and dehiscence of genuine Calliandra.

Calliandra medeilinensis is an ambiguous taxon, fot certainly known outside cuitivation.
In generai aspect and in most macromorphic details the plants resemble C. riparia, but have fewer leaflets that tend to be proportionately wider.
Of the four known collections, three (including the type) have capitula axillary to primary leaves, but one (Soejarte 3379, NY) has the terminal, pseudoracemose inflorescence of C. faicata, which differs, however, in much wider leaflets.
Both C. riparia and C. falcata are commonly planted far beyond their natural range of dispersal, and both are recorded from Colombian urban habitats.
The character-combinations observed in C. medellinensis are plausible attributes of hybrid C. riparia x C. fatcata, but experimental evidence is required to confirm or refute this hypothesis.

Calkiandra guildingii resembles C. fateata, which has larger, more persistent stipules, only incipiently acuminate leaflets, and flowering brachyblasts arranged in leafless or only randomly leafy pseudoracemes.
Whereas C. guifdingsi is found in moist lowland and upland cloud-forest, C. fafcata is adapted to xeromorphic, semideciduous communities, A parallel instance of related but ecologically differentiated species is known in Senna robiniifolia and S. viciifotia, as described by Irwin and Bameby (1982: 520, sequ.).
The species further is suggestive of an extreme form of C. surinamensis in which the leaflets are reduced in number to three or five, exceptionally six pairs per pinna and reciprocally dilated.
Its lighescent, vertically venulose pod recalls that of C. magdatlenae, but the papery seed-testa lacking pleurogram is that of the C. surinarmensis complex.

The presumed relationship of C. falcata to C. guildingii is based on resemblance in many characters; differences in stipules, stressed in Key III, are differences in size rather than kind.
The different habitats are surely significant.
The inflorescence architecture of C. guildingii is that expected in sect. Androcallis, but that of C. faicata is at least sometimes that established in sect. Caifiandra, a terminal efoliate pseudoraceme, here interpreted as independently derived by suppression or partial suppression of many distal primary leaves.
The loss of distal leaves is perhaps related to the ecology of the species.
The nomenclature of C. faicata is not well documented, No type of the species was found at Kew in 1994/6, but its identity is vouched for by material from near Caracas identified by Bentham and agreeing with the original description.
Catfiandra faicata was cultivated on Martinique in the mid-nineteenth century and seems to have been dispersed from the Botanical Garden there to similar institutions in the Old World.
Kew possesses authentic material of C. futgens, which in context of C. falcata is somewhat unusual in its narrow leaflets, but which cannot be accommodated elsewhere in the genus as presently known.
Its reputed origin in Mexico is no doubt a mistake.
It has been equated (in herb.
K) with the related C. haematocephata, but the leaflets are fewer than in any wild Bolivian matieral of that species and the flower lacks the characteristic reflexed fringe of sterile filaments in the mouth of the filament tube which is its signature.
No type of either C. sexjanioides, proceeding from Marintinique in 1900, nor of C. amblyphytia Harms, dating to about 1921 in equatorial Africa, survived the disaster at Berlin, and as no duplicate material of either has been located, interpretation depends entirely on the protologues.
Typical C. falcata was at the Frinidad Botanical Garden at this time, and contemporaneously at Buitenzorg.

In seasonally dry subtropical woodland and woodland-savanna transition, 240-800 m., native and locally abundant in the foothills of the Bolivian Andes, between 14°S and 18°S latitude, the dispersal given in greater detail under the varieties; widely dispersed in cultivation, — Powder-puff tree; pompon, bellota; flor de ia cruz, As broadly defined by the foregoing description, C. haematocephala is distinguished among unijugate calliandeas not by any one character nor by any combination of characters derived from foliage or indumentum, both of which are inordinately variable, but by the following features of the inflorescence: flowers not less than 25 per capitulum, in bud crowded into a blackberry-like ball; perianth glabrous, the calyx and the corolla-tube striate; filaments monocyclic, several of them separating from the tube below its orifice, where the interfilamental membranes are produced into a corona of inwardly reflexed, pallid erose scales that contrast in color with the blood-red tassel; and a nectarial disc, in bisexual flowers, that embraces the glabrous ovary.
Parts of the C. haematecephala complex have been revised by Cowan (1963) and by Nevling and Elias (1971).
Cowan recognized C. haematocephaia sens. str, which is widespread in cultivation but not exactly matched by any wild plant, as specifically distinct from C. inaequilatera Rusby, which is known from native populations as well as from cultivars.
Nevling and Elias, after analysis of more material, found no substantial differences between these two, and suggested further that C. bofiviana Britton, which has precisely the flowers of C. haematocephaia but simplified teaves and larger leaflets and is, moreover, sympatric with C. inaequilatera, could well be included, at some infraspecific level, in an expanded C. haematocephala.
The new material now available for comparative study confirms this view of C. boliviana.
There include, further, two shadowy taxa: C. fidgens Hooker f., supposedly of Mexican origin but known only from cultivated stock; and C. novaesii Hoehne, described from eastern S40 Paulo, Brazil, where it has hat since been encounted in the wild, My conclusion that C. Aaematocephata consists of one polymorphic species composed of relatively few native populations and several more or less ambiguous cultivars, all of which are conveniently disposed in two varieties, is expressed in the following key.

Strictly typical C. Aaematocephala has relatively small (to about 2-4.5 x 0.7-1.2 cm), facially glabrous leaflets; it is commonly cultivated in Asia and is most closely approached, but not precisely matched, by R. S. Williams s.n. from the fo Kaka near Isapuri (NY) and (ex char.) the holotypus of C. novaesit, Calliandra inaequilatera, the form most frequently grown in North America, differs ta random degrees in facially pubescent leaflets mostly reaching 5-7.5 x 1-2.8 cm.
In occasional leaves of this form one of a pair of pinnae may have 5-7 pairs of leaflets whereas the other has only four pairs.
In C, fidgens, which may have arisen in cultivation, the feaflets are 3-4 pairs in all pinnae.
A form cultivated in the Caroline Islands (Salsede 139, NY) has the leaf-formuta of C. fulgens but broader leaflets.
The ultimate provenance of the plants grown at Calcutta and in Java from which Hasskarl described C. haematocephaia is unknown.
Nevling and Elias, having established the taxonomic equivalence of C. haemaiocephala and C. inaequilatera, assumed that the former must have been introduced from the region of Guanaf in Bolivia, either by Hasskarl himself or by H. A. Weddell, both of whom are known to have trayeled in the region between 1842 and 1853, in search of Cinchona.
According tc one hypothesis, plants were collected by Hasskarl himself, perhaps described by him on board ship between Perm and Java, and attributed to the Calcutta garden in order to conceal his role in smuggling living Cinchona out of Bolivia.
Alternatively, it was Weddell who obtained seeds of the Caitiandra, which passed to Calcutta either through Paris or London.
There is, however, only circumstantial evidence in favor of either hypothesis and none to favor one over the other.
It is worth noting that Hasskar] described in the same paper (Retzia 1: 214.
1855) a Calliandra sancti-pauli, likewise grown at Bogor, this said to have originated in Sao Paulo (see synonymy of C. foliolesa, p. 000) and to have come to Java by way of Utrecht.
Several channels of communication between Bogor and Europe were open, and in absence of positive evidence the route taken by Calhaematocephala is unknowable.

Sympatric or closely vicariant relatives are: C. bombycina, ecologically modified in seasonally dry woodland of the Huallaga Valley in Peru and morphologically differentiated by striate corofla and more numerous stamens, red throughout; C. jariensis, local in Para, and C. harrisii, of the Andean foothills in Bolivia and of extraAmazonian Brazil, together characterized by pinnate venation of the leaflets; C. glyphoxyion of the west slope of the Andes in Ecuador, which see for differential characters; and C. Aymenaeodes, of Atlantic lowlands in the Guianas, deceptively similar except for simply pinnate, not bipinnate, leaves.
Outside Amazonia the species is represented further by scarcely differentiated varieties localized in northwestern Peru, inter-Andean southem Colombia, and tropical North America, as described in the following pages.

In lowland rain forest, often riparian, sometimes entering the understory, and in igapé woodland, 80- 11G0(-1300) m, interruptedly widespread over and almost confined to the n.-w. half of the Amazon basin, from the upper Putumayo, Caquet4, and Apoporis Valleys in Colombia e. to w.

Amazonas, Venezuela. — Map 31. — Flowering intermittently throughout the year, the rhychm of anthesis of particular populations not known.
Variation in length and in length proportionate to diameter of the calyx, from the short-campanulate extreme in the typus of C. trinervia to the wbular extreme exemplified by Schultes & Cabrera 12787 (NY), is continuous, and the variety could be further divided only arbitrarily by application of this critetion.
I have found no reliable correlation between features of the calyx and indumentum, though the populations in central Amazonia are more frequently glabrous and have on the average shorter calyces than those further west.
Over most of the variety's range the stipules are obtusely deltate and not more than 3 mm long, but occasional collections from Colombia, not otherwise different, have the lanceolate stipules characteristic of var. ptfesifolia.
Variation in length of peripheral corollas and androecia appears random.
From available samples the pod seems to be narrower in central Amazonia than in Amazonian Ecuador and Peru.
Most collections from western Amazonia here teferred to var. trinervia or var. paniculans have been misidentified as C. carbonaria.
Calliandra rotundiJotia Killip & Macbride, which I confidently reduce lo var. frinervia, was perceived by its authors as distinct from Peruvian var. paniculans, but was not directly compared with genuine C. trinervia, a species inexactly characterized in Flora of Peru.

Bentham's descriptions of C. trinervia and C. carbonaria, published simultaneously and each based on only one collection, call for no contrast between them other than the slightly narrower (falcate-oblong, not falcate-ovate) distal leaflets of carbonaria combined with slightly longer (2, not !, mm) calyx and shorter (2, not 344, lines) corolla.
Specimens of C. trinervia collected in Amazonia in recent decades show that both calyx and corolla vary greatly, and independently, in length, and no alternative criteria have been found.
Calliandra carbonaria is consequently interpreted as a montane derivative of the frinervia complex feebly distinguished by leaflets on the average a little narrower, uniformly red filaments, and dispersal.

The pilose indumentum of C. pifosifolia is its single feature consistently foreign to C. trinervia sens. lat. and falls short of a specific character.
Lanceolate stipules, much exaggerated in Maguire 2842/ (NY), are a noteworthy feature of the variety, but occur also in some forms of glabrate var. The flowers of the Venezuelan type and paratypes of C. pilosifotia are relatively large, but not larger than those of all C. trinervia.
A smaller-flowered variant has been distinguished in manuscript as C. julianii Brunner & Forero.

Without fruit it can be reliably distinguished from var. trinervia only by its distantly disjunct dispersal in the Northern Hemisphere (see maps 31, 32).
The segregates reduced above to synonymy of var. arborea each have some slight peculianty: Annestia splendens an anomalously long androecial tube; A. rekoi relatively short leaflet-pulvinules; and A. centralis the pulvinules of the last with (apparently) dark ted tassel.
The last-mentioned has been equated in the literature with C. emarginata, and could be a variant of it with acuminate leaflets.

Colombia HI-V, VII-IX, in Venezuela XII-IV, VII, in the Guianas and Paré V-IX, XL, the full cycle not documented, The comprehensive concept of C. coriacea expressed in the foregoing synonymy and description has been built up by accretion of geographic elements that were mistaken at first for closely related but distinet taxa.
The historic nucleus of C. coriacea, based on a unicate specimen collected at an unrecorded locality, very likely in Colombia, by Humboldt, was unknown to Bentham, who redescribed it as a var. glaberrima of the upland Ecuadorean C. glyphoxyton, obviously different in copious loose pubescence, larger stipules, shorter leaf-stalks, 8 (not 6)-foliolate leaves, capitula of not less than thirty flowers, and few (16-18) stamens per flower.
The typical, Colombian C. coriacea has ali flowers of the capitulum homomorphic or almost so, with slenderly tubular androecium 19-35 mm long. In southwest Venezuela the otherwise similar riparian calliandra has at least incipiently heteromorphic flowers, with slightly shorter corolla mostly 8-10 (not 10-13) mm long and androecial tubes mostly 10-17 mm long. In preliminary studies these plants were segregated as a var. aquae-nigrae Barneby, a manuscript name that has no nomenclatural status.
The plants of the Guianas and adjoining Brazil were described as C. anthoniae in order to corect their previous misidentification, by Anthonia Kleinhoonte, as C. tergemina (Linnaeus) Bentham, and to provide a name, no longer needed, for an account of Calliandra for Flora of the Guianas, then in preparation.
As monographic studies progressed, nothing of substance could be found to distinguish anthoniae from Colombian C. coriacea or, for that matter, from the localized Belizean populations described by Lundell as C. rivalis.
Calliandra coriacea differs ideally from superficially similar C. rrinervia (sens. lat.) in nearly elliptic leaflets with subequally convex anterior and posterior margins, in fruits stiffly ascending from the branches like those of C. angustefolia, and in smaller seeds.
In Venezuela, however, the leaflets are sometimes a little wider on the anterior side of the costa, and the attitude of the fruits needs confirmation in the field.
The species as a whole is more easily separable from telated C. angustifotia by its 4)-foliolate pinnae and by much larger distal leaflets.
Differential characters of the also related C. antioquiae are brought out in the protologue of that species, next following.

Within its interrupted range south of the Hylaea C. harrisit is the only member of ser. Macrophytiae with primarily pinnate venation; in other respects it resembles C. tergemina sens. lat. The plumply obtusely angulate pod is unique in the genus; its sutural ribs are so far enlarged at expense of the narrow valves as almost or quite to conceal them from external view, and the cross-section has become bluntly 8-shaped.
The dispersal of C. harrisii is difficult to account for, the known populations being so far apart and apparently adapted to diverse associations and microclimates.

As defined by the foregoing description, C. tergemina is a variable species of wide dispersal, polymorphic in indumentum, amplitude of leaflets, depth of calyx, color of the stamens, and in occurrence of a pleurogram on the seed coat.
At the time that Bentham (1875: 336, sequ) published his summary account of Calliandra, comparatively few collections of C. tergemina and its relatives were accessible.
From this biased evidence a glabrous Antillian C. tergemina characterized by a tiny calyx (41 mm or less), and continental larger-leaved C. emarginata (Guerrero), C. seemanni (Panama) and C. canescens the last three collectively different in longer calyces and C. canescens yet further in pubescent foliage, seemed plausibly distinct taxa.
It is now apparent that the formulae known to Bentham amounted to a random sample of character-states that exist in Mexico and Central America, for many another syndrome of pubescence, leaf-size, leaftexture (and prominence of venulation), leaflet-outline, length (absolute and proportional) of corolla and stamens has been discovered since.
Those known to Britton and Rose in 1928 were either maintained or described as species of Annestia (ser. Tergeminae, it 4— 18, incl.).
This classification was rejected by Standley and Steyermark (1946; 22, sub C. emarginata) as unrealistic.
Standley and Steyermark recognized in the flora of Guatemala only two species in this complex, the glabrous C. emarginata, and C. mexicana, different solely in leaflets at least dorsally pilose, each equally variable in other features and representing probably only one species.
Mc Yaugh (1987: 155) described for Flora Nove-Galiciana a glabrate form of C. emarginata growing with an otherwise uniformly pubescent population.
Development of indumentum, which sometimes extends to the calyx and perianth, is visually arresting, but has no practical taxonomic application.
Equally striking is the range of variation in size and outline of leaflets, which tend to be proportionately broader and more obtuse as they increase in length.
But the variation is continuous; moreover an occasional vigorous shoot with ample leaflets arises from a small-Jeaved parent branch.
A like pattern of continuous variation devalues color of the perianth (white, greenish, pink, carmine) and androecium, which varies from white through particolored carmine) to carmine throughout, as a useful taxonomic character.
Texture of leaflets is modified by age, season, and microhabitat.
The small calyx characteristic of C. tergemina as represented on the Lesser Antilles and coastal northeastern Venezuela coincides with a striate corolla tube; but in west-central Caribbean Venezuela the calyx becomes insensibly deeper and the venulation of the corolla by degrees less distinct, thereby passing into forms outwardly indistinguishable from Central American examples of C. emarginata.
On the other hand, Pirttier 8822 (NY) from near Valencia, Carabobo has the longer calyx of emarginaia combined with the striate tube of typical tergemina.
In fact C. tergemina, by historic accident the first to be named, is nothing more than a peripheral expression of a specific type widely dispersed around the western Caribbean and northward.
Mere difficult to compress into one species is variation in the seed-coat, which has no pleurogram in the Antilles, but is without exception picurogrammic in Mexico, However, the Panamanian type of C. seemannii has the relatively deep calyx of C. emarginata combined with the plain testa of typical C. tergemina.
The alternative to a conservative taxonomy, already adopted in part by Standley and Mc Vaugh, is an intricate Hasslerian proliferation of names based on particular specimens.
Provisionally included in my concept of var. emarginata is a series of relatively microphyll races or forms in which the larger distal leaflets, even of primary leaves, are less than 2 cm or even less than 1.5 cm long. Their biological status requires further study, but is is likely that they are not a monophyletic group but paralle] derivatives of var. emarginata s.lat., different one from the next in details of pubescence, venation, and color of perianth and androecium.
The following list of specimens indicates the scattered occurrence of the microphyll populations within the range of typical emarginata: MEXICO.

Calliandra macqueenii is presumably a recent detivative of C. tergemina var. emarginata, with which it has much in common, but differs substantially in too many details to escape formal description.
As listed in the Latin diagnosis, the principal differential characters include the following: shortly pedunculate capitula of some 20 to 40 flowers crowded along a distinctly elongate receptacle; an extremely long, far-exserted staminal cube; and pods stiffly erect on lignescent peduncles.
The species is dedicated to D. J. Macqueen (OXF), who has recently amassed an extensive herbarium of Mexican and Central American Catfiandra of all types but in particular of species akin to C. houstoniana, an important set of which has been presented to NY.

Pods 1-6 per capitulum, erect, in broad profile 3-7 x 0.4-0.9 cm, the sutural keels in dorsal view +1.4-2.2 mm wide, the coriaceous, recessed valves not or only faintly cross-venulose, finely pilose or puberulent overall, exceptionally glabrate; seeds in broad view orbicular-obovate or elliptic-oblong +5.3-6.5 x 2.5-4.8 mm, the smooth hard testa light brown, speckled or mottled.
Except for the closely related C. pedicetiata, sympatric in Hispaniola but instantly recognized by its umbelliform capitula, C. Aaematomma is the only calliandra with dorsally spiculate primary stipules.
It is heteromarphic in pubescence of leaves and flowers and in number and size of leaflets; moreover, the spicules vary greatly in development, even along one branch.
As material has accumulated, discontinuities between the segregate species and varieties have become increasingly elusive, and the taxonomic level of several has become precarious.
In recognition of this state of affairs, a comprehensive interpretation of C. haematomma seems appropriate.
The key that follows separates seven varietal taxa, but these are uniform neither in area of dispersal nor in degree of internal variability.
The var. glabrata, localized in southeastem Jamaica, has one unique character, a white tassel, which coincides with glabrous corolla, of uncommon occurrence elsewhere.
The vars. focoénsis and tortuénsis are known each from a single population, and are essentially monomorphic, so far as known.
The Cuban var. colletioides has on the average fewer leaflets and simultaneously longer spicules than the rest, and var. rivudaris on the average longer leaf-stalk and bigger leaflets.
Over most of Hispaniola and in scattered stations eastward var. haematomuna has most commonly glabrous leaflets and silky-pubescent corollas, but forms, otherwise identical, that combine glabrous leaflets with glabrous (glabrescent) corollas or pubescent leaflets with either glabrous or silky corollas, occur at random in the same range, sometimes even in one population.
It came as a surprise to find that the Bahaman populations of C. haematomma have appreciably ampler leaflets than those of Hispaniola, such as to deserve equivalent taxonomic status.
There seems to be no pattern to the variation observed in length of calyx and corolla or the proportion between them.
The epithet Aaematomma (Gr. haimat-, blood + onuna, eye or light, in reference to the brilliantly colored filaments) appeared first in the conupt form haematoma, and was shortly afterward republished by Kurt Sprengel as Aaimatostoma (hatmat- + stoma, mouth, without obvious significance).
Both epithets were attributed to Bertero and it is not known which was actually written by him.
In the protologue of C. haematomma that appeared in de Candolle's Mémoires sur la famille des Léguimineuses, in composition although posterior in publication to that in the Prodromus, the epithet is written Aaemaiomma, and it was this form that Bentham transferred to Caffiandra and that has become standardized in modem literature of the Antillean flora.
Herein C. haematostoma Sprengel is treated as an independent, taxonomically superfluous synonym of C. haematomma de Candolle.
The two spellings, as they occur in subsequent literature, are interpreted as orthographic variants.

Calliandra brevicaulis is instantly recognized by its tnily terminal peduncles, and is further notable in its area of dispersal for short stems arising annually from an often strongly lignescent, sometimes creeping rootstock, and for the proportionately great size of the umbelliform capitula.
The plants are diverse in length, orientation, and distribution of hairs on stem, leaves, and flowers, several states of which were described by Hassier as vaneties or forms.
Much of the variation seems random, even though relatively stabilized within a population.
There is, however, a strong correspondence between dispersal, leaflet-number, and pubescence of the flowers which calls for recognition of two infraspecific taxa.

Among Bahian calliandras of ser. Catliandra with deltate calyx-teeth C. asplenioides is recognized by pinnae 3-4 pairs in almost all larger leaves, relatively broad leaflets, and filaments about 24-54 per flower.
In Minas Gerais the sympatric C. fascicuiaia, similar in leaf-formula, has linear or linear-lanceolate, not narrowly oblong, leaflets about 4-8, not 2.44.5, times as long as wide.
The resinous spots or glandular trichomes that are a of C. asplenioides in Minas are rare or absent in C. fasciculata, which has usually longer floral bracts 2.5-15 (not 0.6-1.2) mm long.

VIII-V. Calliandra fasciculata, endemic to upland northem and central Minas Gerais, closely resembles sympatric C. asplenioides (=C. mertensioides Bentham) in habit, and typical var. fascicuéata is hardly different in inflotescence and individual flower.
Bentham (1876: 420) speculated that when better known in the field the two might prove to be conspecific.
The proportionately broader, scarcely auriculate and broadly obtuse leaflets of C. asplenioides that, unlike those of C. fasciculata, are, at least in the common range, resinouspunctate or -papillate dorsally, provide a reliable criterion; the only specimens of ambiguous identity that I have seen are either immature or fragmentary.
The taxonomic status of C. bracteosa, likewise questioned by Bentham (1876: 419), is more difficult to interpret.
Its variably modified calyx, accompanied dy enlarged floral bracts and often by similarly exaggerated stipules, are the only features that distinguish it from typical C. fascicudata, though the perianth usually bears a few, exceptionally many, long straight trichomes, The lengths of calyx-teeth and bracts are, however, poorly correlated and the perianth is sometimes almost gtabrous.
This random inconstancy is outbalanced by multiple resemblances in foliage and corolla, and in consequence C. bracteosa is here teduced to varietal status.
The dispersal of the two varieties of C. fasciculata is peculiar.
The var. fasciculata is best known from the environs of Diamantina and Séro.
It is represented south of this region by only one collection each from Sas. do Cipé and Caraga, and to the northwest by one collection from Sa. do Cabral.
Around Diamantina var. bracteosa is as common as vat. fasciculata, and on Sa. do Cipé much more frequent; northwest from Diamantina it is known only from Mogol and Montes Claros.
On the crest of Sa. do Cipé C. fasciculata is sympatric with the endemic C. finearis, which has essentially the flowers of var. fasciculata but differs in dwarf stature and rhizomatous habit of growth.

In campo rupestre sometimes transitional to campo cerrado or caatinga, m, locally plentiful along and e. of the crest of Chapada Diamantina, from Sas. de Curral Feio and da Jacobina s. through Sa do Tombador to Lengois and Mucugé in lat. 10°20'-13°S. — Fl. XIN Calliandra calycina has nearly the leaf-formula of C. asplenioides except that the pinnae are not more than two pairs; they have similarly short petioles and the individual flowers are similary proportioned.
The leaves of C. calycina are usually more crowded along the stem and the Jeaflets are much narrower (1.1-1.8, not 24.5, mm wide) and more crowded along the pinna-rachis.
T have not found reliable diagnostic features to confirm the segregate C. jacobiana, C. angusta, and C. robusta, which are treated herein as minor variants without taxonomic status.
Renvoize (1981) in his key to Bahian Calliandra distinguished C. jacobina from C. ealycina (sens. str.), both of which were described from Sa. da Jacobina, by color of the filaments: known to be white in C. jacobiana, and supposed to be red in C. catycina.
Neither Blanchet nor Bentham described the filaments of the latter as red, and Blanchet's specimens, now more than a century old, tell nothing certain of flower-color.
Calliandra angusia was separated from C. jacobiana by greater stature (1.75-2, not 7.5, m) and smaller flowers 6, not 10, mm long); but specimens subsequently identified by Renvoize himself (Lewis 853, NY) are described in field-notes as 6-10 dm tall, while the corolla in the type-region of C. angusia varies from about 6 mm to 8.5 mm in length.
The leaflets of the type-collection of C. cafycina are slightly more numerous than those of C. jacobina, but the plants are otherwise extremely similar.
Calliandra robusta has calyces proportionately longer as compared to the corolla, but is otherwise compatible with C. calycina.
A unicate specimen (Harley 16971A, K!) collected with the typus of C. robusta (Harley 16971) and in the same locality as that of C. bahiana (Harley 16985) may provide evidence of introgression between these sympatric species.
The obese perianth and filamentnumber (+124) are reminiscent of C. bahiana, whereas the smooth perianth and upwardly imbricate leaves suggest C. calycina.
The leaf-formula (iii/30) is intermediate, but the leaflets are more like those of C. calycing in other respects.

Peduncles 3.2-8.5 cm, usually ebracteate; capitula the receptacle mm diam; bracts resembling stipules in texture and venation, narrowly ovate or lanceolate 3-6 x 1-2 mm, caducons; fls homomorphic; pedicels 0.8-1.7 x 1.2-1.9 mm, perianth moderately thickened, ochroleucous, either a) proximally smooth and distally granular-papillate, or b) papillate and remotely strigulose overall, or c) smooth but randomly ciliate, or d) distally pilose, the calyx (4-)5-merous, the corolla mostly 4- but by fusion sometimes 3- or 2-merous, the calyx-teeth sometimes weakly 1—3-nerved but the rest externally nerveless; calyx 5.5-9.2 mm, the narrowly lanceolate to narrowly ovate, sometimes unequal teeth (3—) 3.5-7 mm; corolla 6.5—11(-12) mm, either as long as calyx or well exserted, the lobes separated to variable depth, sometimes to the cim of stemonozone; androecium 44—]12-meraus, (2-)2.4-4.1 cm, the stemonozone 1.7-3.5(—4) mm, the tube (S-)7—9 mm, the tassel white, rubescent in age; ovary at anthesis glabrous, pubescent after fertilization.

In unrecorded habitat but to be expected about rock outcrops in campo rupestre, 900-1400 m, known at present only from the type of the species and from that of C. exsudans, both collected in Serra do Sincord, interior Bahia. — Fl. XI-XII. Harms compared C. sincorana with C. fasciculata, which is similar in leaf-formula but has a much shorter calyx.
He expressed no opinion as to the affinities of C. exsudans, which appears in Renvoize's (1981) key to Bahian Calliandra to differ from all relatives in flowers "covered with silver-white needlelike hairs and white These hairs, however, are foreign filaments adhering to the sticky peduncles and perianths, and the exudate consists partly of wind-blown particles of quartz and partly of pallid trichomes such as occur also in the typus of C. sincorana.
The typi of C. sincorana and C. exsudans are dissimilar insofar as the perianth of the latter is a little longer and its androecium about twice as long. In leaf-formula, in individual leaflets, and in bracteate peduncles they are essentially alike, and represent probably two populations of one species.

X—XIL Calliandra semisepulta is narrowly sympatric with C. erubescens and is presumably derived from it by modification of growth-form, its short assurgent, functionally herbaceous stems being in marked contrast to the frutescent framework of adult C. erubescens.
Smaller differences between these two species in stipules, leaflets, peduncles, and individual flowers are noted in the Latin diagnosis.
A perplexing specimen (Lewis in CFCR 6904, K) from the common habitat of C. erubescens and C. semisepulta, which has the ample foliage of the latter but stems more than 3.5 dm tall said to be woody at base, is possibly a hybrid derivative.

The definition of C. houstoniana embodied in the foregoing description breaks with a long tradition of recognizing three, four, or several specific taxa in the group, Material available for study is now plentiful and lately has been enriched by intensive collections of D. J. Macqueen (OXF, generously shared with NY) in tropical Mexico and Central America.
Since Britton and Rose's summary in 1928, the close allies of C. houstoniana have been critically revised in their entirety only by Macqueen and Hemandez (1997), although McVaugh (1987) and Hernandez (1991) have recently presented thoughtful, even though inconclusive, analyses of variation within and between traditionally accepted taxa.
The latter can still be recognized reddily enough, but no longer as morphologically discrete entities, and are reevaluated here as varieties interconnected by intermediate forms.
The Main divisions of C. Aoustoniana sens. lat. are four, characterized as follows: a.
C. houstoniana sens. stt.: Foliage relatively insensitive; leaflets distally incurved or falcate, highly lustrous adaxially, and the midrib decidedly displaced from mid-btade; vesture of inflorescence wholly or in part brown-bronze, fuscous, or black; pedicels relatively short and stout, the pseudoraceme consequently narrow and dense; and androecium uniformly red. b.
C. grandiflora, also known as C. anomaia: Foliage more sensitive; leaflets straight or almost so, either acute or obtuse, with subcentric midrib; pinnae relatively short and numerous; vesture of inflorescence white through shades of gray, brown, and bronze to black, the color transitional in a northwest-southeast cline between Sinaloa, Mexico, and Honduras; and pedicels cither longer or, if no longer, more slender than in the preceding, the pseudoraceme therefore more open; androecium of C. houstoniana sens. str. c. C. calothyrsus: Foliage, Ifts, and inflorescence of C. grandiflora, but perianth glabrous. d.
C. acapulcensis: Close to the preceding except for fewer pinnae and wider leaflets, puberulent perianth, and often bicolored androecium, the tassel rose-carmine in lower half, pallid proximally.
Each of the differentia) characters mentioned in this broad analysis is now known to vary independently of any other.
Furthermore, each of the four idealized but only inexactly definable taxa varies internally in density, length, and orientation of vesture, in leaf-formula, in size and pubescence of leaflets, in size of perianth parts, in outline of flower-buds (from plumply to sfenderly pyriform), and in depth of the sinuses between mature corolla-lobes.
The number of potential character-syndromes seems indefinite, and those known from specimens are much more numerous than the available names.
Most of the segregates described at the specific level by Britton and Rose (1928) are minor variants.
Beside C. acapulcensis, only Anmestia colomasensis, notable for extremely short pinnae and small narrow pod, is provisionally preserved here as an independent taxon.
Particular notice must be taken that the North American species numbered 118 to 122 (incl.) in this account are coextensive with the seven species recently revised by Macqueen and H. Heméndez (1997) under the title Calliandra ser. Racemosae.
Contemporary but independent, these two revisions of one set of closely related taxa were undertaken and carried out in different contexts, mine within the framework of whole genus, the other more intensely focused on an assemblage of species of proven or potential value in tropical agroforestry, especially as sources of fuel.
The synonymy and the definitions of taxa for the most part run parallel.
Such conflict as exists is due to different emphasis on, or different interpretation of, a morphological polymorphism almost universal in the group, complicated by local hybridization between sympatric populations.
The inconvenience of two competing taxonomies proposed almost simultaneously for one group of species is regrettable. [n practice, that of Macqueen is strongly recommended for the taxa of economic importance.
Insofar as my opinions presented herein are significantly different, they should be viewed in the light of a full generic survey.
The classification of ser. Racemmose by Macqueen and Herndndez is supported by intensive fieldwork throughout lowland and tropical montane Mexico and Central America and is influenced by a study of seedling morphology.
It is a pleasure and an agreeable duty to acknowledge Dr.
Macqueen's gift to NY of a substantial sample of his carefully selected and beautifully prepared specimens.

In their key to Houstonianae Britton and Rose (1928: 52) distinguished Anneslia colomasensis by leaflets only 1.5 mm and flowers 6 mm long, but these measurements are not confirmed by the holotype, which has leaflets to 2.8 mm and corolla to 7.7 mm long, The plant is nevertheless peculiar jn its very short pinnae and especially in its short narrow pod.
There seems little of substance to separate A. colomasensis from var. anomala, and what there is will obviously require evaluation when further collections are secured, It was equated with C. grandiflora by Macqueen and H. Hernandez (1997: 23).

In the protologue Bentham twice described the leaves as conjugately bipinnate, but the leaves of the holotypus, annotated in Bentham's hand, have either one pair of pinnae, or two pairs crowded together at tip of leaf-stalk, or (in a few) one perfect pair and one terminal pinna.
Bentham's error of oversight was copied by Britton and Rose (1928) and by Standiey and Steyermark (1946), but does not jeopardize the status of the species, unless the typus itself represents a freak with abnormaily reduced leaf-formula.
Standley and Steyermark (1946) suggested that Caltiandra wendlandii may not be Guatemalan.
However, if the date of collection (4 Jan 1857) is recorded correctly, the rypus must have been collected (Schlechtendal, Bot. Zeit.
15: 278-280.
1858) by Wendland en route with Skinner between Lago Yzaba! and Ciudad Guatemala.
The species should be expected in the cakbelt in southeastem Guatemala.
The typus of C. wendlandii is interpreted by Macqueen and Hemdandez (1997: 23) as decapitated C.

In the smal! Guayanan series of calliandras characterized by parallel primary nervation of leafiets the polymorphic C. ssugoides is recognized by number and size of ventrally glossy leaflets and by lack of granular trichomes; for details see Key IIL.
Its known populations are ecologically restricted and mutually distant in dispersal, and differ one from the next in leaf-formula, pubescence, proportions of calyx to corolla, and filament-number.
The intraspecific variation is analysed in the key that follows, but seems too weak to support the recognition of forma! taxa.

32 Slender macrophyllidious several-stemmed shrubs or subshrubs 6-15 dm with conspicuously dilated foliaceous stipules, either glabrous throughout except for a tuft of pallid hairs in the axil of some older lvs, or for sometimes remotely cili(ol)ate Ifts, or thinly pilose faces of some Ifts, the ample thin-textured Ifts either green or glaucescent, a little paler dorsally, the small umbellate crimson-red fls borne on subfiliform pedicels of variable length, the umbels at first axillary to lvs but by suppression of distal lvs forming a broad-bracteate pseudoraceme projected well above fully expanded foliage.
Stipules broadly reniform or suborbicular from shallowly cordate, semiamplexicaul base, obtuse or apiculate, the larger ones 12-26 x 11-35 mm, all flabellately 7-11-nerved from base and openly reticulate-venulose.
Lf-formuta i/3-5, lfstks (12-)15-28 mm, at middle 0.4-0.8 mm diam; tachis of longer pinnae 2-4.5 cm, the longer interfoliolar segments 7-12 mm, Ift-pulvinules 0.6-1 mm, cross-wrinkled; Ifts little graduated, the blade broadly oblong-elliptic or elliptic-obovate from shallowly broadly semicordate base, obtuse or depressed-deltate at apex, the larger ones 1.7-3.1 x 0.8-1.5 cm, 14-22 times as long as wide; venation palmate-pinnate, the slightly excentric midrib giving rise on cach side to +3-6 major (and random intercalary) secondary nerves, brochidodrome well within the plane margin, the inner posterior primary nerve incurved-ascending to or somewhat short of mid-blade, the whole venation finely sharply prominulous and pallid beneath, usually @ little less so above.
Peduncles (J-)2-4 per node, ebracteolate, the longer ones of a fascicle em x 0.2-0.3 mm, the floral receptacle globose, <1 mm diam; umbels 11-21-fld, the fls homomorphic, the filiform pedicels + unequal, the longer ones of any umbel +1-2 om x 0.1(-G.15) mm, the 4-6 outermost ones subtended by an involucelliform ring of ovate acute green but submembranous bracts 1-4 mm, the inner ones ebracteate; perianth glabrous, green or red, the calyx weakly S-nerved, the corolla externally nerveless; calyx campanulate 0.8-1.4 mm, the obtuse teeth 0.3-0.7 mm; corolla 2.5-2,8 mm, the erect ovate lobes +1.2 mm, androecium 27-30-merous, 6-7 mm, the stemonozone 0.3-0.6 mm, the campanulate tube 1.2— 1.5 mm, the filaments dark wine-red, uniseriate, the intrastaminal disc 0.65-0.8 mm tall; ovary substipitate, glabrous.
Peds 1-2 per umbel, pliantly geotropic, in broad view oblanceolate +6-8 x 0,9-1.2 cm, the sutural ribs relatively slender, <1 mm wide in dorsal view, the lustrous papery, pale brown valves bullately distended over each of 5-8 seeds; dehiscence not seen; seeds (litte known) in broad view 6 x 3.5 mm, the testa pale brown, dull, the shadowy pleurogram not incised.
