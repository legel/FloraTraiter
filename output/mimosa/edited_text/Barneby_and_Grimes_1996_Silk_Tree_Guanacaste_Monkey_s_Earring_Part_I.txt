Hydrochorea gongerijpii is closely selated to H. corymbosa, differing most clearly in more numerous leaflets of narrower outline, but also in flowers on the average fewer per capitulum and a little larger, and in pods, as yet little known, at least on the average a little narrower.
Like that of H. corymbosa, the perianth varies from densely strigulose overall to glabrous except for corolla-lobes minutely ciliolate at apex.
We have found a narrow overlap between the twa species in all measurements, even in leaflet number; but the overlaps are encountered at random and singly, and we have no really ambiguous specimens, The range of H. gonggrijpii lies within the northeastern quarter of that of H. corymbosa (compare Maps 1 and 2) and is there found in essentially the same riparian habitats.
Internal variation, other than in vesture of the perianth, is most marked in amplitude of the perianth, which varies from widely turbinate-campanulate, as in the type of Pithecellobium gonggrijpii, to narrowly and deeply campanulate, as in that of F sabanense; the extremes are strikingly different, but intermediate forms are not uncommon, especially on the Gran Sabana.
A contrast in leaf-formula between leaves of lush vegetative (or juvenile) branches and those of flowering branches of adult trees, which Kleinhoonte incautiously interpreted as indicating specific differentiation of the two precisely sympatric species P. gonggrijpii and P. pullei, is characteristic of the genus; in fact both types of foliage occur in some modem collections Davidse 4893A, NY: lfformulae iii/16 and vii/28!).
This condition was foretold by Sandwith in 1939, when few collections had been made and no direct evidence of it was available.
We have found further that the secondary and tertiary venulation of the leaflets varies in prominence (in the dry state), but this has no correlation with other characters or with dispersal.
It may be due to edaphic influences, or to age of the plant, or to both.
One of the two Brazilian specimens known to us (Pires NY) is notable for an extremely small peripheral flower, resembling that of H. corymbosa, combined with fully immersed venation of the leaflets.
This may possibly represent a taxonomic variant.
The other (Ducke in RB 23236, from Maués, Amazonas), is also small-flowered, but seems otherwise typical.

Hydrochorea corymbosa varies in leaf-formula, flower-size, shape of terminal flowers, and width of fruit, but no pattern of correlation has been found among these or between any one of them and dispersal.
Leaves on vigorous new long-shoots have relatively many and large leaflets, whereas leaves of short lateral branchlets, as exemplified by the typus of Pitheceliabium subcorymbosum, tend to be shorter and fewer.
The peripheral flowers of a capitulum in this species may be uniform or slightly accrescent distally, occasionally becoming transitional to the terminal flower in a combination of slender pedicel and duplex androecium.
The modified terminal flowers may be exactly one per capitulum or two to three, when one it is either sessile or carried up beyond adjacent peripheral flowers on a stalklike pedestal, The calyx in the first case is campanuiate, in the second more deeply campanulate or tubular, Collectors who have noted the color of flowers agree that the filaments are whitish and the corolla greenish white or pink-tinged.
The flawers of Prance 23597 (NY, from Rio Urubi, Amazonas, Brazil) are described as dark red, but this may refer only to the corolla.
Normally the perianth is gray-puberulent, conspicuously graytipped in bud, but a form with glabrous calyx and almost glabrous corolia has been on upper Rfo Branco in Brazil and in neighboring Guyana (cf, Black 51-13300, Maas 6362; both

Hydrochorea marginata is very closely related to H. corymbosa, of which it may be a macrophyllidious derivative.
The two species are alike in ecology, have precisely the same fruit, and, where sympatric, especially when past flowering, are reliably distinguished only by leaf-formula.
While the range of H. marginata nests within that of its commoner relative, and the two species have been collected close together on the upper forks of the Amazon, there is no evidence of intergradation in these circumstances.
Typical var. marginata has essentially the same flower as H. corymbosa, but vars. panurensis and scheryi differ in fewer, larger flowers with a characteristic 5-nerved calyx; the latter simulates H. corymbosa to the extent that random leaves have two pairs of pinnae.
Ducke considered Pithecolobium panurense a mere form of P marginatum, but it is probable that he knew the former only from Bentham's description, Modern collections demonstrate its morphological differences and discrete dispersal.
These are such that a case could be made for maintaining P panurense at a coordinate level with H. marginaia, but the multiple resemblances suggest that they are better assessed as geographic segregates of one species.
Pithecolobium bijugatwn, which has precisely the flower and fruit of H. marginata Vat. panurensis, differs only in somewhat shorter pedicels, random leaves with a second pair of pinnae, and a narrow dispersal along the Orinoco, perhaps in more specialized environment.
It falls without strain into our enlarged concept of H. marginata,

Subarticulatae.
Subsequent collections show it to have flowers and pods indistinguishable from those of H. marginata vat. panurensis, except insofar as the pedicel of the peripheral flowers is decidedly shorter.
As the foliage is otherwise not different from that of A. marginata sens. lat., we interpret P bijugatum as a variety of that species, apparently representing it to the exclusion of other forms on the upper Orinoco river between 5° and 6°N latitude.
From scant information recorded by collectors it appears that var. scheryi is not found in flooded forest but in the woodiand-laja interface, or on rocky riverbanks, perhaps above the floodiine; its ecology needs observation.
Because the epithet bijugatum is misleadingly inappropriate to much of the material examined, we have exercised the privilege of altering the epithet along with the rank.

Hydrochorea acreana is known with certainty from only ovo flowering collections, which differs from other species of Hydrochorea in the panicle of capitula efoliate at anthesis; pending discovery of the fruit its affinity cannot be assessed with finality.
The small peripheral flower with androecium reduced to 10 or 12 members is like that of some forms of the variable H. corymbesa, but the foliage, except for smaller petiolar nectaries, is more reminiscent of Abarema adenophora.

The cladogram suggests that B. leucocalyx is the most primitive of the three specics of the genus; the other two species share a fruit in which the valves become convex at dehiscence.
Balizia leucoecalyx, on the other hand, retains an indehiscent fruit, as does Hydrochorea, though the form of the fruits are decidedly different.

Populations of 8. pedicelfaris on the eastern slope of Chapada Diamantina in Bahia were mentioned by Lewis (1987; 165) as distinguished from the typical form of lowland Atlantic forest by more numerous petiolar nectaries and different indumentum of teaflets.
These plants are indeed aberrant in position of nectaries and in very short tue petiole of the leaves.
Tt is as though a supernumerary pair of short pinnae were inserted at the lowest nectary, which elsewhere is situated well below the first pinna-pair.
In context of the whole species, the indumentum is not really characteristic.
The specimens from prae-Andean Amazonia are indistinguishable morphologically from those of lower Amazonia and the Guianas.
We have no solution to the mystery surrounding Mimosa chrysantha Vahl (Eclog.
Amer. 2: 38, 1798), which Bentham (1875: 588) attributed with reservations to Pithecolobium pedicellare.
The holotypus, collected at Cayenne by von Rohr, was seen by Bentham in Vahl's herbarium, but can no longer be located there (Mrs, Fox Maule, in litt.
!).
The leaf-formula given in the protologue is compatible with B. pediceltaris, but the abscence of petiolar nectary and yellow color of the corolla are not.
De Candolle (Prodr. 2: 471), who knew it only from description, hesitantly referred M. chrysantha to Acacia, The only bipinnate species of Ingcae with yellow flowers likely to have been found in French Guiana is Zygia racemosa, but this has nectaries that could hardly have been overlooked.

Pithecolobium ferrugineum was described from a collection in flower, and this seems to be the only one seen by Bentham, In his monograph of Mimoseae (1875: 584) he nevertheless described the frit as "Jegumen villosum, arcuatum v. circinatum, valvis 6— 8 lin, latis We have seen only one fnit of A. ferruginea, and that fragmentary, but it is glabrous, as is the ovary of all known flowering specimens.
The fruit described by Bentham, as noted by Sandwith in the protologue of P. fanshawei, was collected by Schomburgk and mistakenly associated with P. ferruginewn by Bentham.
Sandwith thought it might belong to P. fanshawei or a close relative; we interpret the broken fragments of foliage as representing A. barbouriana vat. arenaria.
This species is closely related to A. floribunda and perhaps not specifically distinct.
Abarema floribunda, primarily a plant of lower elevations, has leaves of thinner texture, longer leaf-stalks (and consequently proportionately shorter peduncles), and somewhat larger peripheral flowers (as described in the key to species).
The petiolar nectaries of A. ferruginea are flat or shallowly concave, whereas those of typical A. floribunda are convex.
However, a single collection of the upper Mazaruni basin in Guyana, described above as a variant of A, floribunda, with which it agrees in length of peduncles, in texture of foliage, and in size of flowers, has the flat nectaries of almost sympatnic A, ferruginea, flowers only a trifle smaller, and comes from a habitat at 950 m.
Further collecting may show that A. ferruginea is only an upland variant of the already highly variable A. floribunda, but this problem must be postponed for lack of critical material.

Venamo, to be sought on C. Guaiquinima and Chimantatepni. — Map 8, The protologue of P. fongipedunculanum pointed to P. marginatum and P. villiferum as its nearest relatives.
The latter, also native but not endemic to sandstone table mountains of Guayana, differs obviously in softly pubescent hypophyllum of the leaflets and in pubescent ovary conical (not truncate) at apex.
Because fruit and seed are still] unknown in A. villifera, it was not included in the cladistic analysis, where A. longipedunculata is sistet-group to the terminal containing A. floribunda and A. ferruginea.
These together with A. gallorwm form a clade united, in part, by the red or pinkish corolia and stamens.
PitheceHobium marginaturm, superficially similar toa A. fongipedunculata in glabrous foliage and nearly straight pod, differs fundamentally in small longpedicellate peripheral flowers and a pod that when Tipe ctacks transversely between seeds but does not dehisce conventionally through the sutures.
Furthermore its pleurogrammic seeds are quite different from those of A. longipedunculata, which have a characteristic translucent, unmarked testa; and its lowland riparian habitat is further distinctive.
It is referred herein to the genus Hydrochorea, Among the abaremas of the Guayana Highland A. fongipeduncutata is readily known by the combination of low leafformula, glabrous adult foliage, and gently falcate, not circinnate legume.

Assuming that the grossly lignified pods of A. curvicarpa and A, macradenta are homologous, these species must be more closely related to each other than to any known species.
They are further alike in the broader, but otherwise homomorphic flowers and lack of pleurogram on the seed.
Because the two species differ in length of the floral receptacle they are not directly contrasted in the key to the species, as they deserve: The bicentric range of A. curvicarpa, which resembles that of Monopteryx inpae W. Rodrigues (Bameby & Grimes, 1984: 46), coincides with somewhat modified foliage and perhaps with variation in length of the floral receptacle, but this will remain uncertain until flawering material from central Amazonia is obtained.
The fruits ace essentially similar at the extremes of dispersal, but the differences in size and venation of the leaflets require formal recognition.

This is a species ordinarily recognized by tall arborea] stature and either by the enlarged leathery bellShaped petiolar nectary on leaves associated with flowers or by the woody pod grossly enlarged over the seed-locules, or by both.
It appears most closely telated to the Guyanan A. curvicarpa, which has a comparable ligneous pod but patelliform ieaf-nectaries, significantly different leaf-formula, and an extended raceme-axis, There is incipient racial differentiation between the Central American and Ecuadorean populations of A. macradenia, but too little marked as yet to deserve taxonomic separation.
The calyx in Ecuador is on the average smaller (2.5-3.3, not 3.3-4 mm long), and the pod rather narrower (mostly 13-17, not 19-24 mm wide), with shallower transverse depressions between seeds, A sterile specimen from Pacific Colombia (Valle: 10 km NW of Buenaventura; A. Gentry 56959, MO, NY), not certainly of this species, suggests a link between the at-present widely dissevered known localities.
The enlarged petiolar nectary is sometimes eaten down to the base, perhaps by ants, and is not developed in the leaves of saplings or stump-sprouts, leaves twice or more the size of those on fertile branchlets of adult trees.

Etymology: of Ganymedes, cup-bearer to Zeus, in allusion to the cupular petiolar nectaries.
Abarema ganymedea suggests a Pacific counterpart of the Amazonian A. auriculata, from which it differs in more numerous leaflets (see Latin diagnosis for figures) puberulent on lower face, in the cpular (not mounded) petiolar nectary, and (in one known flowering specimen) an androecium reduced to 10 members.
If we correctly associate with the flowering holotype the fruiting specimen (Rubio & Queial 722, NY) from Ecuador, A. ganymedea differs further from A. auriculata in the deeply recessed ventral suture of the pod, which altogether is reminiscent of A. piresii in quasimoniliform outline.

Lf formuia i-iiil-4, Ifts per If; lf-stalks of larger lvs 0.5-8.5 cm, the petiole 0.5-2.6 cm, the one or the longer of 2 interpinnal segments (0.7—)1-3.5 cm, petiolar nectary at or shortly below pulvinules of first pinna-pair verruciform, hemispherical or sometimes vertically elongated, 1-2.5(-3) cm diam at base, as or only half as tall, minutely pored, commonly livid and sometimes microscopically puberulent, similar but smaller nectaries sometimes at further nodes of Lfstk and at tip of pinnae, but the last often lacking; pinnae distally accrescent, the rachis of furthest pair 2.7-8 cm, the longer interfoliolar segments 12-32 mm; pulvinules in dorsal view 1.5-2.5 x 0.8-1.7 mm, closely cross-wrinkled; lfts strongly accrescent distally, the blades obliquely obovate, asymmetrically ovate or incipiently rhombic-ovate, somewhat incurved, at base scarcely or moderately inequilateral, broad-cuneate or rounded, obtuse muticous, the distal pair x (20-)28-45 mm, 1.3-1.9 times as long as wide; the subcentric midrib gently arched forward, the widely ascending secondary veins brochidodrome well within the loosely revolute margin, all these together with random tertiary venules prominulous on both faces but more sharply so beneath.
Peduncles 3,7-11.5 cm; racemes +(20-)30-50-fld, the slenderly clavate receptacle 2-15 mm; bracts not over 1 x 0.5 mm, linear-subulate or subulate, caducous; fls subequiform as to size and shape of S-merous perianth, but the terminal sometimes sessile and with modified androecium, PERIPHERAL FLS: pedicel 0.6-2.5 mm; calyx campanulate 0.7-1.2 mm, the low-deltate teeth 0.!-0.3 mm; corolla greenish 3.2-5 mm, the ovate lobes 1-1.7 mm, microscopically puberulent externally; androecium 10-14-merous, 9-17 mm, the tube including short stemonozone 1.6+2.4 mm; ovary glabrous, conical at apex; style +2 em, the stigma scarcely 0.1 mm diam, not dilated; TERMINAL FL; sessile or almost so, the perianth as in peripheral fs, the androecial tube +2-5 mm.
Pods mostly solitary, subsessile, in profile broad-linear, evenly incurved through almost to somewhat more than a full circle, in profile +5.5-14 x 1.1-2.9 cm, (6-)7-12-seeded, the seminiferous suture either evenly recurved or undulately impressed between seeds, the coriaceous or subligneous valves at first plano-compressed, often but not consistently becoming turgid over each seed, fuscous or nigrescent and coarsely but not prominently venulose when mature, smocth and orange internally, the microscopically puberulent sutures dorsally plane and +2 mm wide to dorsally ridged to 5 mm wide, the valves in cross-section 0.2-2 mm thick, the exocarp and pale crustaceaus endocarp always very thin, the pitchlike mesocarp highly variable (as described under each variety); dehiscence of Abarema, in thick-walled pods tardy, the valves when of thin texture cracking and irregularly separating, when of thick texture continuous; funicles strap-shaped, distally coiled; seeds not seen.
Among lowland abaremas with few large leaflets A. microcalyx is distinguished by the combination of mounded leaf-nectaries and compactly racemose capitula of very small flowers, [tis variable in leaf-formula, the leaflets of the largest leaves of a plant varying in number from 8 to 36, and in both width and texture of the pod.
Narrower, thinner-textured pods have relatively narrow sutures, the seminiferous one undulately impressed between seeds, and mesocarp <0.5 mm thick over each seed, whereas broader thicker pods have wider sutures not or obscurely constricted between seeds and mesocarp about 1-2 mm thick in cross-section.
We have found some variation in morphology of the capiculum, involving length of pedicels and development of a modified central flower, but whereas the characters of leaf-formula and fruit are seemingly well correlated with dispersal and thereby indicate racial differentiation, flowering specimens are as yet too few to establish any significant pattern of variation.

Since Maguire 24629 (NY) from Table Mountain in Surinam was identified by Amshoff (in the 1940s) as Pithecellobium vitliferum, all subsequent collections have been so named in herbaria.
The species is obviously close to A. villifera in habit, indumentum, and broad obovate or rhombic-obovate leaflets, but differs in dispersal, habitat, average leaf-formula, looser capitula, and larger peripheral flowers, as noted in our diagnosis and key to species.
It seems therefore to deserve specific status.
All our material from Venezuela and Guyana has leaflets essentially veinless on the convex upper face and pinnately veined with 8-12 prominent major pairs of almost simple secondary nerves on the dorsal face, in this respect resembling typical A. vitlifera from the upper Rio Negro basin.
The one collection from Surinam has smaller leaves and secondary nerves prominulous on both faces and moreover branched into a mesh of veinlets, a venation recalling the variant of A. villifera described from Rfo Cueiras in the lower Rio Negro basin.
Whether these poorly documented variants are individual variants or have a genetic basis remains to be seen.

In upland and non-inundated lowland, primary and secondary forest and forest-savanna ecotone, widespread over tropical South America from NW Colombia to NE Bolivia, W through Venezuela to Trinidad and Tobago and the Guianas, S in Amazonian Brazil to Rondénia and N Mato Grosso, disjunct in coastal forest of Bahia; Lesser Antilles southward from Guadeloupe: range and elevation more precisely stated under the varieties.
Abarema jupunba is distinguished ideally from close relatives by a syndrome of leaflets finely, often only minutely, strigulose beneath, (b) convex and pored petiolar nectaries, (c) small, shortly pedicellate or subsessile, densely silky flowers, and (d) relatively thin-textured pod with valves uniformly cinnabar-red inside and white-and-blue seeds lacking pleurogram.
It is exceptionally variable in leaf-formula and in size of leaflets, both between branches of one tree and between trees of different populations, The extreme !eaf-forms were treated by Bentham (1875) as Pithecetiobium micradenium and P. trapezifoliun, but the numerous intermediates subsequently discovered and a low correlation between pinna number and either size or number of leaflets precludes recognition of more than one, no differences in either flower or fruit being apparent.
Our concept of P. jupunba is the inclusive one developed by Urban and Britton & Rose.
However, analysis of the copious material now accumulated shows that the macrophyllidious variants of the species occur only in the northeastern quarter of its whole range, in fact displacing the microphyllidions ones in all of Venezuela except its Amazonian corner and Maracaibo basin, and extending beyond Venezuela only into immediately adjoining countries and Dutch and French Guianas. it seems appropriate, therefore, to accept two varieties, even though, however they may be defined, there will inevitably be found some specimens ambiguously poised between them.
Because it comprises forms with larger and smaller leaflets and is one of the most widely dispersed members of its genus, A. jupunba is a conceptually useful prototype of the group of blue-seeded abaremas with thombic or rhombic-obovate leaflets and apically conic ovary, and it provides a standard of comparison against which its more local relatives can be evaluated: in the macrophyllidious direction A. mticrocalyx, longipedunculata, villifera (probably, though pod is unknown), commutata, and adenophora;, in the microphyllidious one A. auricufaia and polymorphic barbouriana.
For diagnostic discussion see the accounts of those species.

Our concept of Abarema barbouriana, which has been reported hitherto only from Panama and northern Colombia, is expanded herein to include Pithecellobium arenariwn of Venezuelan Guayana and northem Amazonian Brazil, P. fanshawei of Guyana and French Guiana, and related forms, never satisfactorily identified, from mountainous northern Venezuela.
It now accommodates a range of leaf-formulas comparable to and only slightly higher than those long admitted to the closely related A. jupunba, and considerable variatian in pubescence of leaflets and pod, in yenulation of leaflets, and in size of floral parts.
Particular characters appear to be linked to dispersal and are dominant locally but feebly correlated; they suggest incipient racial differentiation, but are incalcitrant to precise definition.
As in A. jupunba, we recognize only two subdivisions of the species: a relatively microphyllidious var. barbouriana, most abundant west of the eastern cordillera in Colombia and in east-central Panama, and thence interruptedly scattered eastward to the Guianas; and a relatively macrophyllidious var. arenaria, most frequent on the Gran Sabana and on tepuis of Venezuelan Guayana but recurring in lowland white sand savanna habitats on the sources of Rio Negro in Venezuela and in central Amazonian Brazil.
Each of these varieties encompasses variant populations that are analyzed below but is not further dismembered taxonomically, It should be emphasized that the fruit, except for the length and orientation of its indumentum, remains extremely constant.
As here redefined, A. barbouriana differs from A. jupunba primarily in the larger flower, and not quite consistently in the loose silky pubescence of the hypophyllum.
Where this indumentum is lacking or sparse, the flower is much larger than that of A. Jupunba or the leaflets are smaller and more numerous.
The fruits are essentially alike.

In non-inundated forest, from near sea leve) in Panama and W Colombia to 950 m in Panama (C. 1850 m in Antioquia, Colombia, and 1080 m in Aragua, Venezuela, locally plentiful from centr. Panama (Colén, Panamé, canal zone) ta NW Colombia (Chocé, Antioquia, Valle de Cauca); in mountainous N Venezuela (Aragua, Miranda); and far disjunct in lowland Guyana (Mazaruni and Potaro valleys) and interior French Guiana. — Map 16. — Fl. VIII-11 — Dormildén, pato patoma (Colombia).
The var. barbouriana is known in Panama and Colombia both from near sea level and from upland forest; there is much variation in form and size of the leaf-nectaries, but we find no correlation between these and elevation of habitat.
The pod varies in this same region from strigulose to golden-pilosulous: when pilosulous, it is indistinguishable from that of the remotely allopatric Pithecellobium fanshawei, which we here reduce to synonymy.
A few individual specimens here referred to var. barbouriana deserve brief mention:

The var. arenaria differs from var. barbouriana principally in lower leaf-formula, and, for the most part, var. arenaria has larger 'eaflets with more humerous secondary nerves, and locally it has larger flowers. [1 is racially complex, however, and the number of pinnae, at most 4 or near Manaus occasionally 5 (not 5-12) pairs, is the only dependable criterion.
Six groups of populations are feebly distinguished by combinations of habitat, dispersal, and minor features of the indumentum and flower-size, two of them found in lowland white-savannas of the Rfo Negro basin, two at montane of upland elevations in Venezuelan Guayana, one in Amazonian Colombia, and one in campo of middle Rfo Madeira basin in N Rondénia:

In overall aspect and leaf-formula A. adenophora resembles A. microcalyx, but differs not only in the hypertrophied petiolar-nectaries but in the much larger central flower of the capitula.
The fragmented dispersal of A. adenophora might suggest that more than one taxon lies concealed among the disjunct populations, disguised by the prominently modified nectaries, but we have found nothing in their gross morphology to substantiate this possibility.
The one other abarema with similarly enlarged nectaries, A. macradenia, differs greatly in leaf-formula and ligneous fruit, A leaf from a stump-sprout collected near Manaus (Grimes 3118, NY) has these dimensions: leaf-stalk 4.6 dm; rachis of furthest pinnae 1.9 dm; largest leaflets 12.5—7 cm.
An anomalous fmiting collection from the Ducke Reservation at Manaus has poorly developed leaf-nectaries on the primary Jeaf-stalk but typical cupular ones on the pinna rachises.
A gigantic leaf collected in Zelaya, Nicaragua (Little 25315, US), under the same vernacular name, grano def oro, as Little's fertile no. 25427 (US) is another example of vigorous sapling growth: lf-formula vi/6; lf-stalk +4.5 dm, rachis of longer pinnae to 1.6 dm, terminal Ifts to 7 x 4 cm.
Yet another, (Poveda 1038, F, from Costa Rica—Nicaragua fronticr) perhaps conspecific, has lf-formula v/6, lf-stalk 7 dm, with rachis of larger pinnae 2.3 dm.

In the context of its dispersal A. zollerania is likely to be mistaken only for A. idiopoda, which differs, however, in more numerous (to 18-40, not 11-18 pairs in longer pinnae) and natrower (to 2.5-3.5, not 5-9 mm wide) leaflets, in longer peripheral pedicels (the lowest mostly more, not less than 4 mm long) and in the technical character of apically conic, not truncate ovary.
The perhaps closely related, though distantly allopatric, A. jupurba var. jupunba has leaflets emphatically accrescent upward along the pinna rachis, with terminal pair to 1-2 cm (not 5—9 mm) wide, and a mare densely silky perianth.
The separation between them is weak, and the specific status of A, zollerana somewhat precarious.

Abarema cochleata differs from other paucifcliolate abaremas native to middle and eastern Amazonia by leaflets symmetrically ovate and short-acuminate that assume a characteristic brown and tan coloring when dried.
Within its range of dispersal A. microcadyx var. parauaguarae differs in inequilaterally obovate leaflets combined with mounded, small-pored leaf-nectaries; A. villifera in asymmetrically obovate leaflets softly pubescent beneath; whereas A. mataybifotia has leaflets nearly twice as large, borne on longer pulvinules (5-8, not 1.5-3.5 mm), peripheral flowers of the capitulum a little longer, and a broader pod.
The differential characters of A. campestris are noted under that species.
Abarema jupunba var. trapezifolia, sometimes similar in leaf-formuia, has thombic leaflets puberulent dorsally.
Pithecolobium monitiforme, described from a single tree and collected subsequently only once, differs from typical A, cochleata in texture of the pod's vaives, but apparently in no other feature, and we consider it here as a variety, not specifically separable.
While the exocarp of the pod of A. cachteata is ordinarily <1 mm thick in cross-section, that of P. moniliforme is thickened over each seed into a woody dome nearly 5 mm thick, and the venation, ordinarily superficial and sharply defined, is differentiated neither superficially nor internally.
The pods appear as though galled, but the seeds are well formed.
In English commentary Ducke emphasized the peculiar fruit of P. moniliforme, but in the Latin diagnosis he stated that it differed from P. cochleatum in foliage, though he did not specify in what respect.
The leafformula is i/3, but this occurs in some plants of the Amazon delta that have a pod typical of A. cochfeata.
In size, outline, texture, color, and venation of the leaflets A. cochieata and P. montliforme are identical, as are the capitula and the individual flowers.

III-V. Abarema callejasii is the only known Colombian Species with spicate inflorescence and slenderly pedicellate flowers, and differs further from its neighbor A. lehmannii in dorsally glabrous leaflets, in relatively few-flowered racemes, in longer calyces and androecia, and in falcate rather than spirally coiled fruits.
The species was first collected in May 1944 on the Colombia Cinchona Mission by Earle E. Core (635, NY, US).
The specimens, in young flower, were identified as Pithecellobium by R. S. Cowan, but have since lain among indeterminate Mimosaceae, In 1988, Ricardo Callejas (HUA) at our request revisited Core's locality and obtained the fine flowering and fruiting material on which our description is principally based.
It is a pleasure to dedicate this remarkably distinct, Antioquian tree to an admired friend and obliging colleague.

The one other Abarema with long-spicate inflorescences known from cordilleran Colombia, A. callejasii, has slenderly pedicellate, not sessile flowers, and a falcate, not coiled, pod.
We are indebted to Linda Albert de Escobar for fresh and abundant flowers and fruits of A. fehmannii from mun. Caldas near Medellin, and for color photographs, now filed with the specimens at NY, showing the blue seeds against the background of redbrown endocarp that are characteristic of Abarema.
The epithet popayanense substituted by Barbosa for fehmannii, which is preoccupied in Pithecetlobium but available in Abarema, was suggested (according to annotation) by Lehmann 8623 (GH) from Popayén, herein referred to var.

Abarema brachystachya, A. obovata, and A. filamentosa form a replacement series that runs northward in a narrow ribbon along the Brazilian coast from Parané to El Salvador, but is interrupted in Espirito Santo, where the line turns inland into submontane woodland.
This south-north sequence corresponds more or less exactly with a morphological cline expressed in leaf-formula and in size of leaflets, which are most numerous and smallest in A. brachystachya, fewest and largest in A. filamentosa, and of intermediate size and number in A. obovata.
Taking into account only the larger, fully expanded leaves of any plant, we found in A. brachystachya 48 leaflets per leaf and upwards, in A. obovata 24 to 36 per leaf, and in A. fifamentosa 24 or less.
The smaller, more numerous leaflets tend to be rhombic in outline, the larger ones obliquely obovate.
Leaflets of A. filamenfosa are glabrous throughout, whereas those of A. obovata and A, brachystachya are at least finely ciliolate, and those of A. often pilosulous on ane or both faces.
The basionym Inga brachystachya was known by Bentham (1875: 583) to be a taxonomic synonym of Mimosa lusoria Vellozo, but following the so-called Kew tule, which recognized the first combination in the accepted genus, he treated the species as Pithecolobium lusorium, a name unacceptable under the present code.

The cladistic analysis indicates that A, filamentosa is most closely related to A. cochliacarpos, on the basis of the externally papillate fruit.
Characters of the leaf not amenable to cladistic analysis hint at a relationship to A. brachystackya and A. obovata; for commentary on this relationship, see under A. brachystachya (p. 92).
Abarema filamentosa is indislinguishable from A. turbinata by the characters used in the cladistic analysis, but differs from it also in leaf-formula and size of leaflets, characters not amenable to scoring.
Lewis (1987: 179) suggested that the Amazonian Pithecolobiwn microcalyx and P. parauaquarae (here treated as two varieties of Abarema microcatyx) are conspecific with Abarema filamentosa, but he must have overlooked substantial differences in shape of petiolar nectaries, organization of the pinnae, differences in morphology of the terminal flower, ovary, and internal coloration of the valves.

IX-III. — Barbatimé (NE Brazil, a name shared with Stryphnodendron adstringens, fram the common property of the bark).
Lewis (1987: 178) distinguished the coastal phase of A. cochiiacarpos from the inland one, which tends to be smaller and to have leaflets obovate rather than elliptic and shortly bluntly acuminate; but some material from Rio de Janeiro has similarly shaped leaflets and is said to flower as a bushy treelet.
The species differs from Abarema filamentosa in (inter alia) dense capitula of sessile or subsessile flowers and dull blackish, densely papillate pod-valves.
The pod of populations in Paraiba and Pernambuco tends to be wider (to 14-17 mm) than in those in Bahia southward (10-15 mm).
The epithet cochtiacarpos was so spelled in the original description, but a variant cochleacarpos appeared in the title of the accompanying illustration.
We do not here adopt the spelling preferred by Macbride when he transferred Gomes's epithet to Pitkecellobium, but instead choose the stem vowel -a and the final -os, which seems to indicate a noun in apposition rather than a declinable adjective.

The combination of many narrow, emphatically bicalored leaflets, brownish above and bright green beneath, and short dense racemes of nearly or quite homomarphic flowers distinguishes A. langsdorfii from all other abaremas native in Atlantic southem Brazil, and the species is consequently seldom misidentified.
The displacement of the pleurogram toward base of the seed is a feature unique within Abarema, though encountered rarely elsewhere in Ingeae.
The cladogram (Fig. 4) suggests that on the basis of the homomorphic stamens and pubescent ovary, both homoplasious character states, A. langsdorfit is more closely related to the West Indian members of the genus than to other Brazilian ones.

In foliage characters A. asptenifolia is intermediate between the species A. oppositifotia, A. nipenesis, and A. asplenifolia and the macrophyll ones A. glauca and A. obovalis; for measurements and numbers of leaflets see our key to West Indian Abarema (p. 45).
The subspecies mayarense, which we confidently reduce to synonomy, was supposed to differ from typical asplenifolia in elliptic-obovate leaflets 10-18 x 5-10 mm, lustrous and bullescent on upper face, concave and densely appressed-pilose beneath, and in leaf-rachis 4-8 (not 2.5—5.5) cm long: and it was thought to be geographically disjunct from the west-Cuban var. asplenifolia.
The supposed differences in leaflets are not borne out by the material that we have seen and are not all expressed in the isotype of subsp. mayarense at NY.
It is true that Grisebach described P. asplenifolium from "Cuba but this was a mistake; the isotype (Wright 2403) at GH is labeled "Mayari and no doubt was collected in Oriente Province, as are all modern specimens, and close to the type-locality of subsp. mayarense.
From its dispersal so far as exactly known it is likely that A. asplenifolia is confined to serpentine soils, although the substrate is seldom specifically recorded by collectors.

The epithet discolor is very appropriate to A. glauca, for the leaflets, especially when dry, are notably bicolored, the glaucescent-purplish-gray upper face contrasting with the pale, fresh green hypophyllum, This characteristic foliage combined with umbelliform capitula make it onc of the more easily recognized species of the genus, Contrary to what might be expected from the synonymy, A. glauca is not exceptionally variable; the features stressed by Britton & Rose (1928: 24) as diagnostic for Jupunba discolor and J. savannarum, that is the shape of the calyx and the outline or coloration of the seeds, are insignificant in the context of the larger sample of specimens now available.

In the flora of Cuba and Hispaniola A. abovatis is instantly identified by low leaf-formula and proportionately ample leaflets to 4-6.5 cm long. Its calyx is spathiform in vernation, the teeth developing only as the membranous margin is split by the swelling corolla and androecium.
The 5, rarely 6 teeth, marked only by minute apiculations in vernation, may become simply low-deltate-ovate, or by vertical split at the sinus depressed-deltate and apiculate, and may be of uniform size or appear united in pairs, due to imperfect separation.
The typus of Pithecolobium truncatum is a rare instance of the teeth failing to separate.
No further example is known to us from Oriente, but we have one from Isla de los Pinos, where the normal form is prevalent.
The staminal column varies from 3 to 5.5 mm in length, including the stemonozone.
That of P. pinetorum is at the upper extreme of the observed range of variation, but the typus of this species, except thal it is stressed by pervasive insect damage, is not in any other way remarkable.

In the protologue of Abarema levelii, Cowan found no close relative in Pitheceflobium sens. lat., but temarked that the species differed from all congeners in ieaflet-number and inflorescence.
In reality it is not essentially different in either of those features from A, leucophyila, the reduction of distal leaves to a rudimentary leaf-stalk with nectary being the same in both, and a leaf-formula of i/1, apparently stablized in all leaves of A. fevelii, being frequent in distal leaves and sometimes uniform in all leaves of A. leucoPhylia.
Both species have the dimorphic flowers of Abarema.
A shadow of doubt will linger over the attribution of Pithecellobium flevelti ta Abarema until the fruit and seeds are procured, as flowering specimens are a little unusual in Abarema for the length of the peripheral corollas.
However, the species is otherwise fully compatible with our concept and definition of Abarema, and it cannot be accommodated in any other described genus of Ingeae.
The one Brazilian collection of A. tevelit (S. Hilt 42937, GH, US), from the middie Amazon basin at a point 1400 km distant from the type locality, seems to differ from the Venezuelan plants in slightly shorter corolla and androecium, but it is a good match for the type in other respects.
Obviously much remains to be learned about the morphology and dispersal of A. levelii, Because of a technical difference in leaf-apex, A. tevelii is contrasted in our key to species with A. daeta, but not with its seemingly closer relative A. feucophylta var. leucophylia, which may be separated as follows:

II, IV, VII, the whole cycle unknown.
Abarema viltifera is veadily recognized by few ample leaflets softly silky-villous beneath and by few-flowered capitula.
In foliage it closely resembles the upland and allopatric A. conunutata, which see for comment.
As A. villifera is still unknown in fruit, it is not included in the cladistic analysis, and any relationship implied by its striking similarity to A. commutata remains unconfirmed, On the upper Rio Negro, the leaflets of A. viltifera are pinnately veined, all minor venation being immersed in the epidermis.
One collection from Rio Cueiras, a tributary of the lower Rio Negro shortly upstream from Manaus, differs strikingly in elaborately venulose leaflets and when better known will probably emerge as taxonomically distinct.
The observed differences are as follows:

Abarema josephi is distinguished from the nearly related A. Jekmannii by higher leaf-formula and consequently by more numerous, smaller leaflets.
Additional collections, and mature fruits, are required to confirm its specific status.
The species is dedicated to Dr.
José Cuatrecasas, whose name, like that of Celestino Mutis, is imperishably connected with the Colombian flora.

NICARAGUA, Zelaya: mun. Rama, camino desde "Santa Julia' hasta "La 12°08'-09'N, 60-95 m, 24 mayo 1984 (fr.), Walter Robleto 678 (BM).
Macrophyllidious unarmed trees 17 m tail, 1.5 dm dbh, the lf-axes and lf-buds densely puberulent with incurved sordid hairs to +0.] mm, the lvs moderately bicolored, the Ifts lustrous above, paler beneath, glabrous except for microciliolate midrib and margin, the fls adduced from fr specimens) borne in dense corymbiform capitula on long axillary Stipules early deciduous from small pallid scar, the blade not seen.
Lf-formula (from 2 lvs) iv—v/6; lf-stk +18 cm, the petiole +6 cm, the interpinnal segments scarcely shorter; a sessile round, almost plane nectary 2-2.5 mm diam near midpetiole and one between each pair of pinnae, smaller elliptic, more deeply concave ones on pinna-rachises close below furthest 2-3 pairs of Ifts; pinnae distally accrescent, the rachis of longer ones 11-12 cm, the longer interfoliolar segments 18-23 mm; Ift-pulvinules 2-2.5 x 1.2 mm; Ifts accrescent distally, rhombic-ovate around an incurved subcentric diagonal midrib, at inequilateral base cuneate postically, subtruncate antically, at apex bluntly deltate, the penultimate pairs +3.5-4.5 x 1.7-2,3 mm and about twice as long as wide; the dorsally prominent midrib giving rise to pairs of ascending major primary nerves brochicocrome close within the subrevolute margin and to a reticulum of sinuous venules finely prominulous on both faces, Peduncles (1 seen) in fruit +11 cm; fruiting receptacle together with small terminal pedestal +5 x 4 mm, the pedicel-scars densely crowded, bracts deciduous, not seen; fls unknown, but the pedesta! indicating a terminal fl, and the peripheral ones certainly pedicellate.
Pods solitary, undulately broad-linear, evenly recurved through more than 1 circle, in profile +12 x 1.6-1.8 cm and +12-seeded, the stiffly leathery valves nearly black externally, faintly venulose, framed by sutures +1.5 mm wide, glabrous, biconvex over each seed, the endocarp smooth and lustrous red-brown in seed locule but this girdled with a band of fuscous papilli, the interseminal segments tan; dehiscence of Abarema, the valves elastically sepatating, coiling and twisting; funicle compressed, sigmaid; seeds not seen.
In disturbed forest at 60-90 m, known only from the one collection, bearing dehisced fruit in May.
In foliage the described specimen closely resembles Balizia acreana, and was so identified in 1988 by L. Rico (BM).
The fruit, however, borne on a stout peduncle 1] cm long, a woody pedicel nearly 12 mm long, and a densely flowered claviform receptacle, seems incompatible with Amazonian 8. acreana, the inflorescence of which is a terminal effuse, leafless corymbiform panicle composed of very numerous little corymbiform flower-spikes, with individual peduncle at most 2.5 cm and peripheral pedicels less than 4 mm long. Since the peduncles and pedicels of other abaremas do not elongate appreciably after anthesis, the contrasts in length between those of Balizia acreana and "Abarema are most probably valid, even though made between plants at very different stages of maturity.
The position of the peduncle of "A. cannet certainly be made out from this unique specimen, but it seems to have been borne in the axil of a coeval leaf or immediately below the foliage of the current year.
It could not possibly arise as part of a terminal panicle.
The incomplete materia! precludes full description, but this striking plant cannot go unnoticed.
For the present the name "Abarema ricoae is only provisionally proposed, in honor of Lourdes Rico Arce.

Samanea tubulosa, which as a native tree replaces saman in South America southward from the equator, is readily distinguished from it, when in flower, by the nectary at base of each leafstalk and by (sub)linear floral bracts.
The leaflets of longer pinnae are usually fewer by one or two pairs, and all are puberulent rather than glabrous on the upper face.
Differences between the fruits collected by Spruce at Tarapoto in Peru and those of the genuine sam4n from Caracas were noted by Bentham in his revision of Mimoseae (1875: 587).
In Flora Brastliensis he voiced the suspicion that more than one species lay concealed in his concept of Pithecolobiten saman, but for lack of complete material he could go no further than describe Spruce's plant as a var. acutifolia [sic], supposedly different in characters of foliage rather than fruit.
He was unaware that he had earlier described the same taxon as Cailiandra tubulosa.
The protologue of C. tubulosa was derived from two flowering collections, almost certainly not conspecific: Riedel s.n. from Chapada dos Guimaries near Cuiabd in Mato Grosso; and Gardner 4280 from near the mouth of Rio Francisco in northern Bahia.
The identity of Riedel's plant is now firmly established by fruiting topotypes, but that of Gardner's plant will remain ambiguous until we have confirmatory pods from the region of the type locality.
The known facts of geographical dispersal (cf. Maps 35 and 36) suggest that Gardner's plant is in reality S. inopinata, Our lectotypification of C, tebutosa makes the epithet available and unavoidable for the widespread species described here and bypasses the enigmatic identity of Gardner 1280.
Samanea tubulosa and S. saman are allopatric, so far as known (cf. Maps 34 and 35), but were collected close together on the same day near Chone in Manabi, Ecuador, by L. Holm-Nielsen (nos, 27947 and 27918 respectively, both NY).
Samanea saman is a well-known and presumably native element of seasonally dry forest in Pacific Ecuador, but 5. subufosa is, except for this one record, entirely trans-Andean.
Its status in Ecuador requires observation.

Samanea inopinata is a cryptic species, not certainly distinguishable at anthesis from the closely related S. tubulosa.
The peripheral flowers of the capitula are potentially larger and borne on potentially longer pedicels, and the range in leaf-formula is narrower, but we have found overlap in all vegetative and florai characters that we have measured, The fruit, however, is instantly recognized, for the valves Jack the continuous livid exocarp common to S. tubufosa and S. saman and instead are deeply and closely wrinkled horizontally from one suture to the other.
Fruits of this sort seem to coincide with dispersal shown in Maps 35 and 36.
In our assessment of allopatry we initially ignored flowering specimens, which are inherently ambiguous.
In its two foci of dispersal, as described above, the flower is equally variable in size, but the pod appears to have diverged into two forms.
In eastern Brazil (Mori 12191, NY, the cultivated type collection of Serianthes inopinata), the pod is about 3.5 cm wide and 2 cm thick, with pulpy mesocarp about 6 mm and ligneous endocarp nearly 1 mm thick in section.
By contrast, the populations in and around the Guayana Highland (type collection of Pithecellobium nurtense; Lewis 1422, NY) have pods only 1.5-1.8 cm wide and 1-1.3 cm thick, with mesocarp mm and crustaceous endocarpic walls about 0.2 mm thick in section.
Lewis and Owen (1989: 43) discussed the problem, but postponed a taxonomic Cconclusion until the relationship between these plants and the true saman, which herein is considered itrelevant, might be clarified.
If the apparent difference in fruit-size is confirmed by new collections from the northern and southern lobes of the range of S. inopinata, we would admit P. nuriense as varietally distinct.
The disjunction in range is less compelling insofar as precedents of similar bifocal dispersal without morphological differentiation are wel! established: for examples in Caesalpiniaceae see Senna velutina (Vogel) Irwin & Barneby and Chamaecrista roraimae (Bentham) Irwin & Bameby, described by Irwin and Barneby (1982; 232, 669),

In addition to the type and syntype from Sao José do Lagedo we have seen of L. only one other collection, obtained also in Minas Gerais by Auguste de St. Hilaire in the early nineteenth century.
Unfortunately, neither locality has been identified with assurance, only flowering material was collected, and our picture of the species is thus lamentably incomplete.
Until the fruit is discovered a shadow of doubt remains as to the affinity of the species.
The resemblance to L. incurialfe is, however, so close, that we feel justified in proposing the transfer from Pithecellobium to Leucochloron.
Relatively large stipules at nodes immediately succeeding the perulate scales, relatively low leaf-formula and short leaves, looser hemispherical rather than dense globose capitula, and glabrous corolla are the features on which we depend at present to distinguish L. minarum, but each and all are in need of confirmation.

Britton described Pitheceliobium guantanamense from fruiting material and Ch. baracoénse from a specimen in flower.
The typus of P. guantanamense has leaves of long-shoots with two pairs of pinnae and those of short-shoots with only one pair; that of Ch. baracoénse has most leaves with one pair of pinnae but a developing long-shoot, still immature, shows a leaf with two pairs.
The fruit of Ch. baracoénse was unknown to Britton, but a fmiting collection from close by the type-locality (between Playa Blanca and Jauco, Leén 13300, NY) has the small coiled pod of P. guantanamense.
It seems certain that they represent the same species.
The floral receptacle in Cuba is contracted, and the pedicels are almost obsolete, whereas in Hispaniola the receptacie is fusiform and the pedicels are up to 1 mm long. In the two known flowering specimens we could find no heteromorphic central flower in the capitula, but this may occur in others.
In general aspect and especially in form of the pod Ch. guantanamense seems very closely related to Ch. acacioides, from which it differs little except in the reduced number of pinnae.
From the other Cuban chloroleucon, Ch. mangense var. lentiscifolium, it differs greatly in leafformula, size of leaflets, and spiral pod.

This poorly known species has the multifoliolate leaves of Ch. acacioides combined with the spirally coiled woody pod almost of Ch. senusflorum and is in these respects obviously distinct from all other members of the genus found in northern South America.
The only chloroleucon known to be nearly sympatric with Ch, eurycyclum is Ch. mangense var. teirazyx, grossly different in leaf-formula and in gently faleate pod.

Chleroleucon dumosum, as here defined, is quite yariable in width of leaflets, in length of floral receptacle, and in size of flowers, but we have not discovered any convincing discontinuity in any of these features or any clear correlations between them.
There may, however, be some clinal variation along a northsouth axis from smaller denser to longer looser inflorescence, while the broadest leaflets are yet known from Bahia only.
We have not been able to confirm the great difference in flower-size between Ch, dumosum and Ch. glazioui that was described by Lewis (1987; 165, in clave) and can discern no other critetia, Pitheceliobium vinkatico corresponds with the broad-leaflet type just mentioned.
In the common range, Ch. dwnoswn differs from Ch. fotiolosum and Ch. acacieides in much wider leaflets, but more nearly resembles the first in the form of the fruit.
It tacks the abrupt heteromorphism of the flowers, which is a constant character of Ch. foliolosum and acacivides.
Leaf-formula decisively distinguishes the pubescent form of CA, tenuiflorum, which in Minas Gerais replaces Ch. dumosum to the west of Sa do Espinhago, as does the spirally coiled fruit.

Chloroleucon tenuiflorum is the species long known as Pithecellobiwn scalare, the change of name follows reassessment of the prior Pithecolobium tenuiflorum Bentham.
The species is distinguished by corky bark and a spiral pod similar to that of Ch. tortum, a very close relative allopatric along and near the coast of Rio de Janeiro.
As described above, Chk. tenuiflorum varies much in pubescence, the planaltine Brazilian populations having pilosulous or at least puberulent young stems and leaflets, whereas those of the Paran4 basin southward and westward are, with exceptions such as the typus of P. scalare var. hirsutum Chodat & Hassler, nearly or quite glabrous.
These variants might deserve some intraspecific rank, but we can find nothing to separate them at the specific level.
According to Hoc (1981: 542), the crees of P, teruiflorum increase by sprouting from adventitious buds on the roots.

In South America south of the Equator there are two species of Chioroleucon deceptively similar in finely divided microphyllidious foliage: Ch. foltosum and Ch. acacioides.
The former has a relatively broad, toughly coriaceous pod 13-24 mm wide, either falcate or recurved into an open ring, the latter a thinly leathery pod only 6-7 mm wide, tightly coiled into a compressed spiral.
As shown on Map 39, their canges are vicariant, but on the whole well separated, One fruiting specimen from the Paraguacd basin in Bahia (Machado Portela, J. N. Rese 19964 [NY, US], which we have referred to Ch. foliolosum because of the falcate lignescent fruit, has atypical foliage, with leaf-formula iii-v/17-20 and leaflets to 7 x 1.8 mm, suggesting passage to Ch. dumosum.
Since Ch, folioloswn and Ch. dumosum ace sympatric in this region the possibility of hybridization cannot be dismissed.
We have found no significant difference between Bahian Ch. foliolosum and the populations distantly disjunct in Mato Grosso and northem Argentina that have been described as Pithecellobien myriophylium and P. grisebachianum.

In deciduous and semideciduous, more or less xeromorphic woodland or chaparral at elevations mostly below 600 m, exceptionally to 1200 m, widespread in locally differentiated forms from the margin of the Sonoran Desert in NW Mexico to Colombia, Venezuela and the Antilles, thence S along the E foothills and intermentane valleys of the Andes into NE Bolivia.
Flowering with the flush of new foliage following rains, becoming leafless or nearly so in the dry season; filaments white on expansion, becoming ochroleucous or yellowish when faded.
Excepting only the localized Cuban Ch. guantanamense we here include within Ch. mangense all segregates of Chioroleucon native to Mexico and Central America, Colombia and Venezuela, and the Antilles; and we further extend it to embrace Ch. mathewstt, found around the western edge of the Amazon basin in Peru, northeastern Bolivia, and adjoining Brazil.
In continental South America north of the Amazon River it is the only species of Chloroleucon, other than Ch. foliolosum and Ch. eurycyclum, readily distinguished either by very numerous small leaflets or by tightly coiled fruit, or by both.
Within this extensive range of dispersal, the inflotescence of Ch. mangense cemains monotonously uniform within a quite narrow size range, but there is conspicuous variation in pubescence of the leaves, in number of pinnae and leaflets per leaf, and in both length and width of fruit, which have consequences in width and length of intersemina) septa and in orientation of the seeds.
The variation in pubescence appears almost everywhere random and independent of other factors; despite the importance attached to it in the past, it has no taxonomic significance.
Within each subunit of the species, such as occupies a phytogeographically natural range and is in other respects uniform, there occur perfectly glabrous and more or less densely pubescent populations (or individuals).
These are far from evenly distributed within the species as a whole: Cuban var. /entiscifolia, for example, is prevailingly glabrous but occasionally pilosulous, whereas the reverse is true of var. vincentis and var. feucoSpermum, and al) known examples of var. mangenise and vat. mathewsii are pubescent to some degree.
Length and width of the fully mature pod are, within narrow limits, correlated with dispersal.
However, the length of the fruit is not determined by number of ovules or seeds.
In the long narrow pod of var. feucospermum the seeds are no more numerous than in the shorter and proportionately broader one of var. vincentis, but they stand further apart in narrower tonger locules separated by distinct constrictions of the sutures.
Because of vertical extension and hotizontal constriction of the valves, the seeds are tumed mechanically into a nearly vertical orientation.
Number and reciprocally adjusted size of leaflets are the most obvious differences between geographic races of Ch. mangense, but cate must be taken in interpreting the size.
Stems collected when the flowers are in full anthesis normally bear only immature leaves, with small tender leaflets not yet fully expanded and matetially different in size and texture from those of mature leaves coeval with the fruit.
The smallest leaflets are linear, whereas larger ones vary imperceptibly from narrowly oblong to oblong-elliptic or obovate, and the venation increases in complexity with increase in size.
Marked discontinuities in leaflet-shape between geographically vicariant varieties of Ch. mangense are generally lacking, but in conjunction with fruit characters the average leaf-formula is distinctive.
Geographically central to the species is var. mangense, characterized by high leaf-formula, narrow leaflets, and relatively broad pod with straight sutures, We hypothesize that in context of this species a multifoliolate, microphyll leaf and a relatively wide pod with straight sutures are primitive features.
Passing outward in any direction from the geographic center of the species one encounters progressively fewer leaflets, or narrower pods, or both, and the leafmodification appears to have followed parallel courses in areas now distantly disjunct.
On account of the parallelism, the identity of a given specimen of unknown origin may be unrecognizable by characters of the foliage, but easily known by the pod.
The varieties of Ch. mangense with relatively low leaf-formula and broad leaflets are decisively distinguished from South American Ch, torium and Ch. tenuiflorwn only by straight or falcate but never spirally coiled pod.
Correlation between morphology and dispersal is so nearly perfect in Chk. mangense that we are led to interpret occasional discordant records as due to dispersal by humans.
The single records of var. leucoSpermum in Haiti and at the port of Kingston in Jamaica are examples, There are some genuinely puzzling intermediate forms, the identity of which we may have misinterpreted.
Some plants from northern Falc6n, Venezuela, and from Yucatan Peninsula seem intermediate between Cuban var. lentiscifolium and continental vars. vincentis and leucospermum respectively.
An imperfect flowering specimen from Ecuador (Portovelo, perhaps = Portoviejo, but even the province unknown, J. N. Rose 23452, NY) is ambiguous between vars. mangense and mathewsii.

In the protologue, Jacquin ascribed to Mitnosa mangensis a leaf-formula of v/16, but in 1791 illustrated it by a leaf showing only 12 pairs of leaflets.
Swartz at first identified his Jamaican plant with Jacquin's, but was dissuaded by an apparent disparity in leafletnumber, redescribing the species as M. parvifolia.
Modern material from the westem Caribbean and from Jamaica shows almost the same range of variation in leaf-formula and confirms Bentham's conclusion that these two names apply to one taxon, The continental dispersal of Ch. mangense follows a long-recognized pattern of dispersal that coincides with a belt of drought-deciduons woodland.
The stations in Jamaica are seemingly anomalous, and the species may not be aboriginally native there.
It is not recorded where on Jamaica Swartz collected M. parvbut all subsequent collections are from Kingston or the hill country of parishes immediately adjoining the city.
It was unknown to (or not recorded by) Patrick Browne, and James Macfadyen, writing in 1837, had it only from Kingston and Linguanea, now part of the city itself. inga marthae was recognized as 2 synonym of Pithecellobium parvifolium by Bentham as early as 1844, Albizia marthae was transferred by Niczgoda and Nevling to Pishecellobium on examination of the pollen, which is discordant with that of typical Albizia, they made no comment on the validity of the species within Pithecellobium.

Comparison of Bentham's (1875) diagnoses of Pithecolobiwn parvifolium (our var. mangense) and P, mathewsii reveals objective differences between them only in flower size, in width of leaflets, and in length and width of pods.
The floral differences have turned out to be illusory, but the leaflets of P. mathewsii really ate wider and have a characteristic outline, oblong verging on rhomboid, with distinctly porrect, asymmetric tip unlike those of other forms of Ch. mangense.
The fruit of P. mathewsii is still known from few examples, but seems to be longer and a trifle narrower than that of var mangense and has scarcely a hint of pinched interseminal isthmi.
The multiple similarities to Ch, mangense indicate in our view an essentially conspecific relationship.
Some specimens of var. mathewsii lack the spinescent thorns that ordinarily characterize the genus.
At the variety's southern known limit at 14°44'S in Bolivia Michael Nee has found a completely unarmed population.

Harms distinguished P. caraboboense by pubescent foliage, but glabrous and pubescent plants, otherwise alike, collected subsequently in the state of Carabobo are clearly conspecific.
Before the falcately recurved fruit takes its characteristic form the glabrous state of var. vincentis does indeed resemble Ch. but the fruit indicates a very close relationship with var. mangense, vicaciant immediately westward, from Maracaibo basin into Panama, The variety is only precariously distinguished from var. fentiscifolium by a broader fruit, but the majority of populaons, outside the state of Falcén, have rather more humerous and smaller leaflets.

Except that we extend the synonymy to include Ch. guatemalense and Ch. janglassei, our concept of var. leucospermum coincides with Pithecellobiun leucoSpermum sensu McVaugh (1987; 236), As would be expected from its wide dispersal, there is considerable variation at the populational level, especially in indumentum and width of leaflets.
Pithecolobium leucospermum sens. stt., Ch. langlassei, and CA. guatemalense answer to the pubescent phase that prevails over the variety's whole range, and Ch. undulatum to the glabrous one, which occurs randomly through most of the Mexican range of the variety, from Sonora to Oaxaca.
Among these segregates Ch. langlassei has relatively narrow leaflets, suggestive of var. mangense, but they are less numerous, as are the pinnae, A long narrow pod, undulately constricted between seeds at the flattened isthmi, combined with the low leaf-formula given above, effectively characterizes the taxon.
In Pacific Oaxaca some populations with relatively many and small leaflets might be thought of as intergradient with var. mangense, but have, so far as known to us, the pod of var. feucospermum.
Plants of Yucutin Peninsula with relatively few and ample leaflets are either intermediate to or perhaps as well referred to var. lentiscifotia.
There is no strong evidence one way or the other bearing on the status of var. leucospermum on Jamaica, Hispaniola, or St. Croix, but, as it is known today by only one record from each island, a hypothesis of casual introduction from the mainland is plausible.
The locality in Jamaica (Maxon & Killip 312, NY) is at the port of Kingston where, if native, it could hardly have escaped notice of James Macfadyen, William Harris, or modern collectors; that on Hispaniola (Ekman 5964, NY) is on the south coast of Haiti near the port of Jacmel.
Both of these plants represent the less common glabrous variant mentioned above, The record from St, Croix (Liogier 34208, (NY, in bug) requires fruit for confirmation of variety.
The seeds of var. feucospermum are pallid but not teally white.
Ordinarily the testa is pale fawn-color with a fuscous patch on each face within the pleurogram, but it is sometimes putty-colored overall.

Sphinga platyloba is variable in four respects: habit of growth, leaf-formula, pubescence, and number of stamens.
These variable features are, however, poorly correlated and only partially coincide with discontinuities in dispersal.
In Caribbean South America, whence came the typus, the plants are free-standing, arborescent shrubs, nearly glabrous, with few and relatively ample leaflets (not more than 3 pairs, the largest at least 18 mm long), and stamens about 55-80 in number.
In lowland Yucatdn the habit and vesture are essentially as in Venezuela and Colombia, but the stamens are fewer, about 35-45 per androecium.
In Oaxaca the plant is reportedly either shrubby or sarmentose, the leaflets are smaller and more numerous (3-7 pairs in dista) pinnae and the largest seldom attaining 2 cm in length) and vary moreover from glabrous except for a basal tuft of hairs dorsally to randomly pilesulous on both faces, and the androecium is about 60—-77-merous.
Fhe seemingly isolated populations in coastal Jalisco hardly differ from those in Oaxaca.
In upland Chiapas, S. platyiaba is described in field notes by Breedlove as either a tree, a vine, or a sprawling shrub.
Here the leaflets are relatively small and not less than four pairs in distal pinnae, and commonly are pubescent to some degree, although sometimes glabrate, while random samples of androecia ranged from 40 to 67.
Although differential evolution seems to be proceeding in these segments of the species' range, there is not yet the sort of disparity between them that justifies taxonomic segregation.

The fruit ripens slowly and has been described as indehiscent or almost so, but after falling the valves in fact separate their whole length into a pair of boat-shaped vessels that spill the seed on the ground, Texas ebony is most commonly seen as a shrubby treelet, dark green when foliate, forming thickets in thorn-scrub and chaparral on impermeable caliche substrates, but Isely (1973) reported that in rich bottomland it can attain a stature of 20 m.
The hard wood is used for fenceposts and in Mexico provides excellent charcoal.

On desert hillsides, along washes, and in thin chaparral below 250 m, Jocally plentiful in Baja California Sur, especially but not on the Gulf slope and adjacent islands, and SE Baja California, from Bahia de los Angeles to the Cape (lat. 23°-29°N). — Map 47, — FI, I-IV, the fruit persisting into XII. — Palo fierro.
Ebenopsis confinis is readily distinguished over the greater part of its range by geminate pinnae of all leaves.
The type collection, from Cabo San Lucas, is exceptional in having some leaves with two pairs of pinnae.
The simplified foliage together with condensed capitula rather than amentiform spikes of flowers and the allopatric dispersal in desert environment amply differentiate it from the related E. ebano.
The apparent displacement of the plevrogram from the broad face to the edge of the seed is due to deformation of the seed itself by confinement in a relatively narrow locule.

Painteria elachistophylia is known from disjunct, desert or desertic enclaves, and the leaflet-number and pubescence show some differentiation between populations.
In the Chihuahuan Desert the leaflets are mostly 3-5 pairs per pinna and thinly pilesulous, at least on the lower face.
In San Luis Potosf and Puebla the leaflets are 5—7, rarely 8 or randomly up to 12 pairs pet pinna and glabrous except for cilia.
These states correspond with P. elachisiophylla and P. compacta as defined by Britton and Rose.
In Nuevo Leén we find instances (e.g., Mueller 961, NY) of 6-7 pairs of pubescent leaflets and in Tamaulipas one (M. C. Johnsion 10469, NY) of 3-4 pairs of glabrous leaflets.
Britton and Rose assigned to their two species peduncles essentially none as opposed to very short, but we have not found this a useful differential character.
An exceptionally robust plant from municipio Rayén, San Luis (Fryxelf 36/0, NY) has shortly but distinctly spiciform capitula.

XIE, IV. Macrosamanea macrocalyx has the habit and long whitish, externally silky perianth of its genus, but differs from the original nucleus of antecedent Pithecellobium ser. Coriacea in a tumid calyx (resembling that of /nga inflata Ducke) long in proportion to the corolla, in lack of nectary on bracts of the capitula, and in having two or three gynoecia (like Affonsea Saint Hilaire) to a flower.
Of these features only the inflated calyx is unique to M, macrocalyx, the naked bracts are shared by M. kegelii, and random flowers of M. consanguinea and M. froesit have twinned pistils.
The varzea habitat is consistent with Macrosamanea.
Ducke, who discovered and named the species, referred it to ser. Coriacea, from which it could be excluded only by overemphasizing the significance of the modified calyx.

F. Delta-Amacuro, Venezuela. — Map 49. — FI. (IV) VIl-XIl. — Pashaquilla, yaku-pashuca (in Maynas, Peru).
Ample multifoliolate leaves with sharply acute sigmoid leaflets coinciding with extremely long narrow flowers and broad pod make M. spruceana virtually unmistakable at all seasons.
It is the commonest and most often collected Macrosamanea of western Amazonia, from where it may likely have been brought down to Pard by floodwater.
Its remotely disjunct occurrence in the Orinoco delta is less easily explained.
These Venezuelan populations are represented in herbaria by indifferent material, the identity of which needs confirmation.

In igap6 woodland below 250 m, known at present from upper Rio Vaupés in long. 70°00'-70°45'W, Com. Vaupés, Colombia; from a creek affluent to Rio Guainfa near Limoncito (#2°40'N, 67° 30°W) near San Carlos, and at mouth of Rfo Casiquiare in SW T. F. Amazonas, Venezuela; and from Rfo Preto, affluent of Rio Negro at +64°W in Amazonas, Brazil. — Map 49. — Fl. VI-IX(-?). — Arepiilo, guamo del rio.
Macrosamanea consanguinea was described from specimens in bud, and its status, other than a close relationship to M. spruceana, has remained questionable, Four collections from Mité, on the upper Vaupés in Colombia, in foliage closely comparable with the type but bearing mature flowers and almost ripe fruits, confirm the tentative diagnosis by Cowan.
The species now appears to differ from M. spruceana in proportionately wider leaflets, materially shorter calyx and corolla, and an androecium of twice as many filaments.
Fruits of Macrosamanea are variable in both length and width, and distinctions at this level are precarious; nevertheless one example of fruiting M. consanguinea (Zarucchi 2188, MO, US) has a pod much narrower than anything yet seen in M. spruceana, and this may provide a further diagnostic character.
The difference in color of the flowers' indumentum menioned in the protologue is seemingly due to immaturity rather than to any inherent quality of the hairs.
In one flower bud of the type collection there are three ovaries and in a flower of Aymard 9078 (NY) there are two.

Primary axis of pseudoraceme +2—4 cm; peduncles 2-5 at most nodes, 6-11 num; capitula 2-6-fld, the axis <2 mm; bracts deltate +1 mm, the first charged ventrally with a horny sectary; fls sessile, the perianth 5-merous, externally brown-puberulent; calyx campanulate 8-11 x 3.5-4.5 mm, the triangular teeth to 1.5-3.5 mm; corolla 22-30(-31) mm; androecium +112-merous and 4—4.5 cm, the stemonozone nearly 2 mm, the tube a trifle longer than the corolla, ovaries sometimes 2, the style +5 cm, the stigma punctiform.

Macrosamanea froesit, first collected by R. Lemos Frées at igarapé Jatuarana on lower Rio Urubt in 1949, has been confused with Pithecellobium lindsaeifolum (M. pubiramea var. of this revision) and M. spruceana. lt has the porrectly acute leaflets of the latter, but calices only half as long and depauperate capitula of only two to six flowers; the capitula and leaflet-shape are incompatible with Mf. pubiramea.
The closest relative is Mf. consanguinea, allopatric in southwestem Venezuela and adjoining Colombia, which has the porrect leaflet-tip of M. froesii and can have on occasion comparably few-flowered capitula, but is different in fewer and wider leaflets, as described in the feregoing diagnosis.
As material accumulates, these two species may prove collectively to constitute a small-flowered variety or subspecies of M. spruceana.
One flower from the type specimen was found on dissection to contain two perfect ovaries, but we suppose this to be an anomaly.

Macrosamanea discolor is closely related to M. pubiramea, of which it has nearly the individual flower, but is distinguished, at least in typical form, by reduction of pinnae to one or two pairs per leaf, and by depauperate capitula of at most a dozen flowers.
In width proportionate to length, its leaflets resemble those of Mf. pubiramea var. lindsaeifolia, with which it is rather widely sympatric and from which it may be derived.
With some hesitation we recognize two varieties of M. discolor, seemingly differentiated by habitat but not always cleanly separable in the herbarium.
The var. arenicofa appears to occupy an enclave within the range of var. discolor and to be found in wet savanna rather than on flooded river banks, but its ecology requires study in the field.
The description of Macrosamanea aquatica and Pithecellobium subaquaticwm from parts of one collection was an accidental duplication.
The types are unquestionably conspecific with the original Inga discolor, discovered by Humboldt on the Orinoco a lite more than 100 km upstream from Sanariapo.
Bentham had lost sight of the genuine M. discolor, which lay buried in his concept of Pithecellobiun adiantifoliwn, and when rediscovered was unidentifiable in Bentham's monograph.

[V-X. Macrasamanea duckei is in foliage somewhat intermediate between M. amplissima and M. pubiramea var. findsaeifolia, having relatively broad rhombic leaflets that recall M. amplissima but a leaf-formula more nearly compatible with that of var. findsaeifolia.
It differs decisively from both in the small flowers, and further from 4. amplissima in lack of pedicels.
We have found no reliable specific differences between typical M. duckei and Pithecellobium scandens, which Ducke himself (1949: 40) admitted were similar, When first described, they appeared to differ in leaf-formula, in P. duckei idi/6-9, in P. scandens ii-iv/7-13, but the smail gap in numbers is now spanned by intermediates.
Following the pattern prevalent in the Mimosaceae, the size of leaflets incteases as the number delines, and vice versa.
The collective range of the two forms is a very natural one.

Macrosamanea pubiramea is the most widely dispersed species of the genus and also the most variable in number of pinnae and in number and size of leaflets.
As defined by the foregoing description it includes Bentham's Pithecolobiwm adiantifolium var. muttipinnim, P. longifiorum, and P. lindsaeifoliwn; moder collectors have not confirmed the habital differences that Bentham (1875: 590) thought might distinguish P, adiantifolium from the rest.
Over much of the range of the species (Map 51) there is no difficulty in separating a var. pubiramea, with relatively narrow leaflets, from a var. tindsaetfolia, with broader ones.
The var. pubiramea is the only form encountered in the Guianas or in Amazonian Brazil downstream from Manaus, whereas var. findsaeifolia almost completely replaces it northwestward from the mouth of the Rio Negro, We have from the banks of the lower R(o Negro, however, examples of both varieties, and also of the related M. discolor, and some ambiguous forms thal may represent introgression among the three.
The riparian habitat is the same for all of them, so the opportunity for hybridization may easily arise.
A few random records of one variety deep within the range of the other are perhaps based on individual variation too literally interpreted.
The name P. adiantifolium: is illegitimate (see under M. discolor), and P. longifiorum is junior by three years 10 Inga pubiramea, which provides the unfamiliar, but unavoidable epithet in Macrosamanea.

When referring M, kegelii to his set.
Coriacea, Bentham remarked on the thin texture and pallid coloration of the foliage, which are reminiscent of some species of Zygia sect. Zygiopsis, and the relatively short androecial tube, at that time not otherwise known in the series.
The species remains somewhat anomalous in Macrosamanea in two respects: the cauline inflorescence of shortly pedunculate fewflowered capitula, in which the peduncles are subtended by a rudimentary leaf-stalk and nectary, and the lack of nectary on the floral bracts, These two characters occur in species of Zygia, but coincide there with the small, short-calyxed Zygia flower.
In proportionate lengths of calyx and corollas and in naked floral bracts M. kegetiz is technically similar to the isolated 4. macrocalyx, but differs significantly and obviously in leaf-formula, shape of leaflets, and cauliflory.
The fruit of M. kegelii, when discovered, may Contribute to our understanding of its affinities within Macrosamanea, which Kleinhoonte tentatively questioned, or to related zygioid genera.

Albizia polycephata and its North American analogue A. tomentosa provide a blueprint, as it were, for the sect, Arthrosamanea, having the essential characters of the group but without any striking individual one: elaborate leaves, effuse panicles of small white capitula, and plano-compressed papery pods hardly different from those of A, julibrissin.
They are very closely related and far from easy to separate in clearly contrasting terms, but A. polycephala is on the average a smaller tree when full grown, has a further exserted panicle of more densely pubescent and on the average slightly smaller flowers, and only 9-14, not 18-32 stamens in the peripheral flowers.
Their remotely vicariant ranges of dispersal furnish the most accessible criterion.

Albizia edwallii is closely related to A. polycephala, from which it differs in more coarsely divided leaves, in larger, more evidently venulose leaflets, and in more contracted panicles of pseudoracemes immersed in contemporary leaves.
The individual flowers are a little larger and tend to be less densely silky-pubescent, while the stamens of peripheral flowers are slightly more numerous and longer.
Burkart, who overlooked P. edwallii, contrasted the glabrous pod of his A. austrobrasilica with the supposedly rufous-tomentellous pod of Pithecellobium polycephalum as described by Bentham.
It is, however, only in a very immature stage of development that the pod-valves of A. polycephala are tomentulose; at maturity they became glabrous, lustrous and venulose like those of A. edwailti.
Although the morphological differences (summarized in the key that follows) are weak, they are reinforced by the allopatry of the species, one north and the other south of the Tropic line.
The following key contrasts Albizia polycephaia and A. edwailii.

This still imperfectly known albizia was mistaken by Burkart for A. pelycephala, a species of tropical dispersal different in palmately nerved leaflets and sericeous perianth, although similar in general facies.
Tt seems more nearly related to extratropical A. edwailii and to the southern populations of A. niopoides that have been distinguished as A. hassileri.
These have similar glabrescent perianth but differ in palmately nerved leaflets with evidently, often strongly displaced costa.

As defined by the foregoing description and synonymy, A. tomentosa is polymorphic in foliage, though nearly uniform, except for length of filaments, in the flower, and essentially so in form of the fruit.
On the Pacific slope the leaf-formula is mostly iiv/6-9(-10) and the androecium is 12-17 mm long; on the Gulf-Caribbean slope the leaf-formula is v—xii and the androecium of peripheral flowers is only 9.5-12 mm long. The leaflets vary in outline and proportions, being generally broader when fewer, and more inequilateral when more numerous and narrower, but the variation is far from stabilized on either slope of the continent.
The eastern form is confined to the selva mediana caducifolia of the coastal plain and lower interior foothills.
We suspect that A. purpusii, cotresponding with the eastem phase of the species, may deserve infraspecific rank.
Albizzia hummeliana was described from a fruiting specimen of this phase of A. tomentosa.

For lack of adequate materials we have but an imprecise perception of A. sinaloénsis, which seems in most respects a form of A. tomentosa adapted to the severe climate around the south margin of the Sonoran Desert, The capitula of homomorphic flowers axillary to coeval leaves set the species apart from all other New World Adbiziae, and recall species of Havardia.
On the basis of overall similarity of fruit and seeds with small plevrogram and horny ridge produced from hilum to near the pleurogram (the latter unknown to us in other New World Ingeae), we assume a close relationship to A. tomentosa, The descriptions by Britton and Rose (1928: 45) suggest a difference in leaf-formula (A. tomentosa ili-iv/6-11; A. stnaloénsis vi-ix/12-15), but this has proved ineffective.

Artibonite and Nord. — Fl. fr. ripe in XI. Until the flowers are obtained, the affinities, even the genus, of A. Jeonardit will remain controversial.
Assuming that it is correctly placed in Albizia sect. Arthrosamanea, as the ripe fruit and incipient inflorescence suggest, and that it is native in the chaparral of remote northwest Haiti, the chances of its having been described previously are extremely small.
In the setting of Hispaniola, 4. feonardii is obviously different from the native A. berteriana and the introduced A. carbonaria in leaf-formula alone; and from the common weedy A. lebbeck in smailer leaves and leaflets, and narrower, thinly papery pod not raised as a dome over each seed (the seeds moreover one-half smaller).
For ecogeographic reasons we have compared A. leonardii also with Pseudosamanea cubana, but this not only has the characteristic leaflet-venation of its genus but densely tomentulose pods containing 24-30 (not about 14) seeds.
The pod of A. feonardii, detached from the inflorescence, might pass for that of Acacia, Leucaena, or Lysiloma.
The plant is unarmed, which is unusual in American Acacia, and does not resemble in habit or foliage any species of the genus known from Hispaniola (see Bameby & Zanoni, Moscosoa 5: 4-27.
1989).
Leucaena is represented on Hispaniola by L. leucecephala (Lamarck) DeWit and L. pseudotrichodes de Candolle, unmistakably different in foliage.
And the two species of Lysiloma that reach Hispaniola from the west are so distinct in leafletvenation, membranous stipules, and livid exfoliating epidermis of the pod-valves that they can be set aside as irrelevant.
We accept in principle that description of a new species from imperfect or litigious material is to be discouraged.
Here, however, we have a tree, forming part of a highly endangered flora, that has been known for 65 years, but has only recently and only once been seen again.
Presumably it is rare, local, and a candidate for protection in its native habitat and for propagation in horticulture, We feel justified in these circumstances in placing its existence on record, in the hope that doing sc will encourage further abservation of its morphology and relationships.

Albizia niopoides is most reliably characterized in the context of its immediate relatives by the combination of numerous narrow leaflets and a glabrous, wing-marginate pod that shows no sign, even after dehiscence, of transverse fracture between seeds.
Its discontinuous range has encouraged local variations in leaf-formula, indumentum, and size of flowers, but these are, with one exception, poorly correlated with each other or with dispersal patterns, and some specimens of what has been called Pithecolobium caribaeum in Mexico and the Antilles are identical with some that have passed in Paraguay and one on the Brazilian Planalto as P. hassieri, The type of P. niopoides has the smallest flowers so far known in the species, but no other distinctive quality.
However, no fmit of P, niopoides from the Amazon valley is available for comparison, and this might possibly provide a surprise.
At the western edge of Amazonia, in Ecuador and Peru, the leaf-formuta rises from an average iv-x/35-50 to ix—xix/45-60, and the leafstalks become relatively much longer than elsewhere.
However, random occurrence of high leaflet-numbers are known to coincide with relatively few pairs of pinnae, which weakens the contrast.
A single indiyidual from the northwest comer of Panama (Pto Obaldia, Pittier 4326, NY) has the high leaf-formula of the sub-Andean populations, but larger and glabrate perianth, suggesting the vicariant A. colombiana, mentioned in the next paragraph.
Immature specimens collected at Tarapoto (dept. and prov. San Martin), Peru by Spruce (4407, NY) and misidentified by Bentham (1875: 591) as Pithecolobiwm polycephalum suggest an aberrant form of A. niopoides with relatively few (to 22) pairs of relatively broad leaflets 2.5 mm wide).
Complementary fruits from the same region are necessary for interpretation of these enigmatic plants.
In northem Colombia and northwest Venezuela the commonest form of A. atopoides is almost glabrous, has relatively low leaf-formula, and leaflets wider and further distant along the pinna-rachis than elsewhere, and the pod tends to be very dark-colored and pruimose (as though glaucous) when ripe.
This has been described as Albizia colombiana and is retained here at the rank of variety.

Pods unknown, In unrecorded habitat at +125 m, to be expected in seasonally dry brush-woodland, known only from the type locality in the Maracaibo basin, Venezuela, — Fl. II-1.
Albizia buntingii belongs to a group of species that are separable at anthesis by rather subtle characters of pubescence, leaflet-number, -size, and -venation, flower-size, and number of filaments in peripheral flowers of the capitulum, but are suprisingly diverse in ultimate form of the pod.
In absence of this, the true close affinity of A. buntingii cannot be assessed, and we have contrasted it in the diagnosis with species that are known to occur nearest to it, and with which in practice it is most likely to be confused.
Albizia niopoides, the one of these that is known to occur also, and in two varieties, in the Maracaibo basin, differs most obviously in that its longer pinnae are composed of 30-40 (not 11-12) pairs of leaflets at most 1-2 (not 4-5) mm wide, Albizia barinensis, primarily of the Orinoco basin in Venezuela, has both pinnae and leaflets rather more numerous and peripheral flowers at once subsessile and pilosulous.
Albizia glabripetala, from the periphery of Guayana far to the southeast of the Maracaibo basin, resembles A. buntingif in often pedicellate flowers, but has narrower, more numerous leaflets and only haif as many (+16, not 28-30) stamens per flower.
Finally, the widely dispersed A. subdimidiata differs in fewer, mostly 2-4 pairs of pinnae, somewhat broader leaflets, almost or truly sessile peripheral flowers, and substantially smaller corolla about 2-3,3 (not 44.5) mm long. Of the four species just compared with A. buntingii, the first two bave plano-compressed acacia-like pods inettly dehiscent through the sutures, whereas the pods of the last two are lomentiform, indehiscent in the strict sense, but tend to split transversely between seeds.
It is not possible to foretell to which type, if either, the pod of A. buntingit will conform.

Among related albizias with multifoliolate leaves, A. carbonaria is notable for the dorsally pallid leaflets, the dense golden indumentum of the inflorescence, the distinctly pediceled flowers, and the papery tomentulose pod.
Its rapid growth and open crown recommend it as a shade tree in cafetales, where it has been planted far outside its native range.

(IV)V-IX; fr. long-persistent on branches, sometimes coeval with new fls. — Abey blanco, haja menuda, morura blance (Cuba); candelén, corbano, corbano blanco (Domincan Republic), When fresh, the amply multifoliolate leaves of A. erteriana are dark lustrous green on the upper face, a little paler and dull below.
The prolific terminal panicles of papery stramineous pods persist at tip of dead leafless branchlets well into the dry season, falling at random, and piling up in windrows under the tree.
In drying, the pod valves develop a transverse fracture line between seeds, but disarticulate only reluctantly, and hardly deserve the term lomentiform, less so, in any case, than those of A. subdimidiata and kindred.
The inconsiderable genus Pseudalbizzia Britton & Rose was based exclusively on this feature of the fruit.
Seeds of A. berteriana collected at JBSD (Barneby s.n.) had phanerocotylar germination and two, opposite, simply pinnate (10—12-foliclate) eophytls.

Ix-L — Angico (Brazil); manariballi (Guyana), Albizia glabripetala has been recognized from the first as closely related to the widespread and rather variable A. niopoides trom which it differs most clearly in the tardily segmented valves of the pad and lack of wing along its ventral suture.
Slightly fewer stamens and, on the average, fewer leaflets also, are weak supporting characters.
It is more readily distinguished from allopatric A. pofycephala, to which Bentham referred the earliest collection (Schomburgk 525), by the glabrate, not silky-pilosulous perianth.
A Single large uee m, 8 dm dbh) in Reserva Ecolégica de Maracé (Roraima), sampled both in flower (Lewis 1652, NY) and in fruit (Lewis 1533, NY), differs from typical A. glabripetala, which is also recorded from Ilha de Maracd (Milliken 88, NY), in these characters and is provisionally excluded from our description of the species: relatively ample, oblong-elliptic leaflets to 10 x 4 mm; capitula to 7 per node of inflorescence; peripheral flowers subsessile and a trifle larger (calyx +2 mm and corolla to 4.2 mm); androecium of peripheral flowers to 22-merous; pod smaller and narrower (7-8 x 1.1 cm).
It is perhaps a distinct taxon, needing further observation,

In context of its immediate relatives A. pistaciifolia is instantly recognized by leaf-formula of 1 or Jess often 2 pairs of pinnae and not more than 6 pairs of relatively ample, venulose leaflets.
The foliage in gross aspect recalls that of the Hispaniolan Cojoba filipes (Ventenat) Barneby & Grimes, which differs in organization of the inflorescence and the entirely different, subterete fleshy fruit.
The proliferation of names applied to A. pistaciifotia is accidental and not the result of critical differentiation.
When Bentham recognized Pithecolobium triJlorum, he was ignorant of the true nature of the prior Mimosa pistacitfolia and also of the seemingly lomentiform pod, which, on discovery, was described as Pithecolobium daulense.
Pittier compared Samanea guajacifotia to Pithecellobiun marginatum, comparable indeed in superficial aspects of the pod but fundamentally different in the corymbiform capitula elevated on a long axillary peduncle.

In practice the accompanying dispersal map should be most helpful in placing flowering specimens of the three species, only two of which are narrowly sympatric, and those only in the lower Amazon valley.
Albizia subdimidiata is variable in pubescence of young stems, in amplitude of foliage, in several small features of the individual flower, and in width of pod, but we can discern only one localized race sufficiently modified to deserve taxonomic status,

The var. subdimidiata is somewhat variable in pubescence and in width of the pod.
Most populations in the Orinoco basin and the Guianas have minutely puberulent young branchlets, and the pods often transiently so, whereas in Amazonia the branchlets are glabrous (and commonly atrocastaneous in color), and the pods are glabrate at a very early stage.
The differences are slight and seem taxonomically unimportant.
No geographic correlation with width of pod has been detected.

Following Bentham, who for lack of the telltale fruits confused the relatively local A. nuitiflora of the Pacific slope with the much more widely dispersed Amazonian A. subdimidiata, botanists have universally misapplied the epithet multiffora.
The fruit of genuine A. mudtiflora, well described by A. Gentry (1988, L. c., as Pithecellabium paucipinnatwn), is a plumply compressed, pithy-lignescent pod more than 1.5 cm wide that has almost straight sutural margins and only cryptically segmented valves, whereas that of A. subdimidiata is leathery plano-compressed and only 8-14 mm wide, with margins undulately pinched between seeds and transverse fracture lines externally evident at an early stage of maturity.
The prolonged eclipse of genuine A, multiflora in the shadow if A, subdimidiata induced the superfluous description of Pithecolobium weberbaueri and Albizia paucipinnata.

While fully endorsing Burkart's definition of this species, we disagree with his proposed nomenclature.
Acacia multiflora K. Sprengel was described from a Sello specimen, now lost, in a phrase of only 14 words and in terms so generalized that its identity, in absence of a type, is essentially unknowable.
Bentham (1875: 591) thought it "very probable" that Sprengel's name might be equated with A. multiffora Kunth, but Bentham took an extremely broad and now indefensible view of the latter species.
Burkart promoted Bentham's probability inte virtual certainty, adding that the species might be recognized, in the context of Sello's itineraries, by the falcate leaflets.
There is nothing in the diagnosis, however, to show that the type actually came from southern Brazil (though this is probable) and not a word on structure of the androecium that might exclude A. multiflora Sprengel from the genus Acacia as now constituted, or from other genera of Mimosoideae.
If it were indeed an Albizia or a Pithecellobium, it might as well, from the scant morphological and geographic data in the protologue, be applicable to Afbizia edwailii, found commonly on Sello's route through Paran4 and Santa Catarina.
We consider A. multiflora Sprengel a nomen dubium.
Furthermore, it has not been noticed that when Sprengel substimted for his posterior multiflora a new epithet, this was spelled polyanthes (in accusative case polyanthen, not polyantham), When transferred by Burkart to Arthrosamanea the epithet should have been A. polyanthes.
The spelling and use of this combination are, however, of no more than academic interest now thal a yet earlier name for the taxon involved has been found, It is not without misgiving that we here reduce Enterolobium polycephalwn Grisebach to synonymy of A. inundata.
Burkart regarded them, first in genus Arthrosamanea and later in genus Cathormion, as closely related species distinguished by habit of growth, length of pseudoracemes (vaguely precised), chromosome-number, and (indecisively) stamennumber.
When the stamens fall within the range of 32- 37, numbers often encountered in peripheral flowers of the capitulum, and no data on habit or chromosomes are available, the two taxa are practically indistinguishable.
The dwarf, stooling form described as polycephata by Burkart may be distinctive in the field, but we can find nothing by which to recognize it in the herbarium.
The polyploidy (2n = 52) ascribed to A. inundata by Burkart (1952: 108, sub A. polycephata) requires testing not only in Argentina but in the disjunct populations in the Sao Francisco and Amazon basins in Brazil, Compare Hoc, 1992b: 260, sequ.

Albizia chinensis is one of a small group of southeast Asian species characterized by dimidiate leaflets.
In this group, as shown by Nielsen (1979b:; 221), it is readily distinguished by the combination of enlarged foliaceous stipules, indehiscent pods, and smal] pleurogram situated close above the hilum of the seed.
From A. julibrissin it differs further in the paniculately branched inflorescence with straight or at least not abruptly zigzag primary axis and less clearly differentiated terminal flower in the capitula.
